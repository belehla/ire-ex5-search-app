Weir said several questions reporters asked President Biden at the conclusion of his news conference today about economic worries back home hinted at dim prospects for near term global cooperation on climate change.  \"I was just struck by the questions about inflation, about ... the cost of your Thanksgiving meal or your toys that were made in China for Christmas,\" said Weir.  \"All of the leaders here are dealing with those pressures in the moment at the same time,\" he continued. \"Unfortunately those concerns of today are eating ... the livable futures of tomorrow.\" US President Joe Biden criticized China and Russia for not doing more to tackle the climate crisis during a news conference at the COP26 climate summit.  “I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China, links back to China not showing up,” Biden said in response to a question from CNN’s Phil Mattingly.  “The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, 'what value added are they providing?' And they've lost an ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP, the same way I would argue with regard to Russia,” Biden said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin both did not attend the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, which is widely seen as the most important international climate talks in years.  The President said: “We showed up, and by showing up we've had a profound impact on the way I think the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role.” Speaking more broadly about relations with China, Biden said he was not worried about armed conflict occurring. He said he has made it clear to the Chinese President in his hours of conversation with him that “this is competition, it does not have to be conflict.”  “I’m not looking for, I don't anticipate there will be a need for, to be, there be physical conflict,” Biden said. A reporter asked President Joe Biden why he thinks the US and its lawmakers should get behind spending on climate action when other nations, such as China and Russia, won't. CBS Reporter Nancy Cordes asked: \"Some of the commitments you made here won't happen unless Congress passes future legislation. How do you convince Republicans and even some Democrats to get behind more spending if they look at this conference and say, 'China isn't meeting these global goals. Russia doesn't intend to meet these global goals. India doesn't plan to, why should we?'\"  Biden answered: \"Because we want to be able to breathe. And we want to be able to lead the world.\" He added: \"The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader, not showing up? Come on. The single most important thing that's gotten the attention of the world is climate. Everywhere. From Iceland to Australia. It just is a gigantic issue, and [China] walked away. How do you do that and claim to be able to have any leadership now? Same with Putin.\" Some background: Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping did not attend the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland. US President Biden said acting on the climate crisis is \"not just a moral imperative, it's an economic imperative as well.\" \"Investing in our clean energy future is an enormous opportunity, enormous opportunity for every country to create good paying jobs and spur a broad-based economic recovery,\" he said in remarks at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.  Biden also touted his economic agenda as Democrats back in the US continue to negotiate over specifics.  \"When I think of climate crisis, I think of jobs. And that's what the Build Back Better framework will do for the American people. It's going to bring historic investment in clean energy, addressing the climate crisis. It's going to cut greenhouse gas emissions by well over a gigaton by 2030. It's going to save consumers money on their energy bills and with tax credits or things like installing solar panels and weatherization of their homes. It's also going to provide manufacturing credits to make sure the United States is competing in energy markets of the future, like solar panels and wind turbines. It's also going to accelerate electric vehicles and electric school buses and build a nationwide network of 5,000 charging stations to power them,\" he said.  Biden added: \"It's about jobs. It's about competitiveness versus complacency. It's about making the world safer, cleaner, healthier, a place for our children and children all around the world to look to the future in a way that they can't now.\" More than 100 world leaders, representing more than 85% of the planet's forests, agreeing to ending and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030 is a \"great example of the kind of ambition we need\" in action against climate change, US President Joe Biden said Tuesday. \"The United States is proud to have initiated and supported it. For our part, the United States is going to keep raising ambition, and delivering the goal we are reducing US emissions by 50-52% ... by 2030. This decade, we have to make significant progress,\" he said at a press conference in Glasgow, Scotland. \"I can't think of two days where more has been accomplished — dealing with climate — than these two days,\" he added of the COP26 summit in Glasgow. In a message to world leaders and key figures present at the summit he said: \"Glasgow must start — and I know you're tired of hearing me say it but — a decisive decade of action, so we can keep the limit of 1.5 degrees within the reach of us and the rest of the world. We have to keep accelerating our progress.\" The President of Malawi criticized wealthy nations that fail to live up to financial pledges to developing countries meant for damage caused by climate change.  “It just spells out more death and more devastation and more catastrophe around the world, in particular for the least developed nations and the nations of the sea,” Lazarus Chakwera told CNN's Lynda Kinkade from the COP26 Summit on Tuesday. “It's important that developed nations recognize the fact that humanity is one, and they cannot be safe when everybody else is unsafe,” Chakwera continued, adding it is now “recognized that this [climate change] is something we all face together.”  The issue of whether wealthy industrialized countries should pay for the damage already caused by climate change has been a key point at the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland. For years, poorer nations have urged for climate reparations, saying they depend on them for their survival. To date, the financing promised to developing nations under the Paris Agreement is meant to be used to transition their economies and prepare for future climate change as opposed to dealing with the damage already done.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck an optimistic tone on US policy on climate and on whether the world could trust any American administration on the issue, given the seesawing in the past few years. \"What's changed now is the voters in our countries want change and want us to fix this thing,\" Johnson said Tuesday. He added: \"I believe Joe [Biden] understands that, and I think people are enthusiastic about his agenda to fix it. But i think any future president of the United States is going to be responding to strong, strong, democratic pressure to join and support the rest of the world in fixing climate change.\" The people see climate change as one of their priorities, he told CNN.  \"People can see climate change is happening. They can see wildfires and flooding. They can see that something out of the normal weather events is taking place,\" he said. \"And it's moving up their agenda.\" Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates and the European Union launched a joint investment deal, aiming to provide up to half the finance needed to create affordable green technologies for Europe, which will also benefit the world, they said. Gates formally signed the EU-Catalyst partnership on behalf of his company Breakthrough Energy Catalyst at COP26 in Glasgow on Tuesday. “The European Commission is joining forces with Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and with the European Investment Bank. We will scale up critical green technologies and create markets for them,” said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who shared the stage with Gates and Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank. The deal aims to mobilize up to $1 billion between 2022 and 2026 in financing projects in the hydrogen, aviation, energy storage and air capture industries. Each euro of public funds is expected to leverage three euros of private funds, according to the EU Commission.  The launch comes after it was revealed that the delivery of $100 billion per year in climate finance, which rich countries promised developing countries under the Paris Agreement, would be delayed until 2023. But private sector investment is a critical part of the solution, according to all three signatories of the EU-Catalyst partnership. “The total green premium right now would be about five trillion per year,” said Gates. “Unless we reduce the cost of green products even at $100 billion — which is fair to say we need to push aggressively to achieve that — would only be less than 2% of what it would cost to subsidize these green activities for the developing countries. So, the innovation side is going to bear a lot of the burden of making it affordable for the world to do these things.” President of the European Investment Bank Werner Hoyer added: “It is quite obvious that the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and the climate objective of Paris will not be achievable with public money only. The development of these new technologies cannot wait 15 or 20 years. I don't blame private banks for instance that they do not finance this, because it is too risky for them.” He went on to say that is why support is needed at the beginning from the EU Commission, member states and supporters like Bill Gates to accelerate the development of green technology. President Joe Biden and Britain's Prince Charles met on Tuesday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, with the two leaders using the encounter to discuss \"the importance of global cooperation in tackling climate change,\" a senior administration official told CNN.  The official said that Biden and Prince Charles met on the sidelines of the conference, which – now in its second day – has featured nearly 120 world leaders addressing the climate crisis and how to address it.  \"They underlined the need for ambitious commitments and concrete actions among partners worldwide and discussed Prince Charles' initiatives to engage the private sector on sustainability,\" the official said of the meeting.   \"President Biden reaffirmed the strength of the enduring ties between the United Kingdom and the United States, and he thanked the United Kingdom for hosting COP26,\" the official added. \"He commended the Royal Family for its dedication to climate issues, particularly Prince Charles' environmental activism over the last half century.\" The meeting comes as leaders gathered in Glasgow, including Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to commit to changes in their countries to slow down and mitigate the effects of climate change. Biden on Tuesday targeted planet-warming methane emissions, announcing strong new US regulations and launching a Global Methane Pledge, in partnership with the European Union, that has been signed by around 100 countries.  For his part, Prince Charles on Monday implored countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change.  \"My plea today is for countries to come together to create the environment that enables every sector of industry to take the action required. We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,\" he said. He also charged that climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and put the world on \"war-like footing.\"  Boris Johnson struggled to explain his decision not to wear a mask while sitting next to 95-year-old environmentalist David Attenborough as he tried to put a positive spin on this week's COP26 climate summit. \"I've been wearing masks in confined spaces with people I don't normally talk to ... it's up to people to take a judgment whether they're at a reasonable distance from someone ... that's the approach we take,\" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The British Prime Minister struck a somber tone on the state of the climate emergency, saying \"I think you've got to be gloom and doom until we fix this thing.\" Johnson hailed some of the early agreements reached at the summit, including a pact to reduce deforestation, but said the world had to be humbled in the face of the \"huge\" climate crisis. He also said his government was committing to reducing its reliance on coal, despite the prospect of a controversial new mine opening in northwest England. \"I don't want more coal, and our government doesn't want more coal. We'll do what we're legally able to do,\" Johnson said. Read more from his interview with CNN here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is “cautiously optimistic” about commitments made at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday, but warned “those commitments will be useless unless promises here are followed up on.” In his closing address, Johnson cautioned against “false hopes,” saying that the world “still has a very long way to go.” With world leaders, including himself, set to depart the summit, which continues for another 10 days, Johnson said he will “watch proceedings to make sure there are no U-turns.” The “eyes of the world are on our negotiators, and we have your numbers,” he told leaders. Lauding the pledges made over the past two days, Johnson said 90% of the world’s economy is now working toward net-zero emissions, compared to a third when the UK introduced the targets. A big win, he said, was India “keeping one billion tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere by switching half its power grid to renewable energy.” “It’s not just that we are putting forward better or bigger targets, but the world is putting forward the plans to reach those targets,” Johnson said. While appearing buoyed by the perceived success of the summit, he tempered expectations.  “The clock of the doomsday device is still ticking but we have a bomb disposal team on site,” he said.  Nontokozo Moloi, Laura Berry and Margaret Bondziedu Impraim have been walking around the COP26 summit venue with a climate countdown clock, trying to raise awareness of the incredibly short time the world has to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. The young climate activists are part of a project to get the world to #ActInTime. They are hoping the clock will help shift the narrative on when emissions need to decline. “It's not by 2030 and it's not by 2050,” Berry told CNN. “It displays the amount of time left that we have at current rates of emissions until our carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming runs out. So right now we have about 7.75 years, until 1.5 degrees of warming is inevitable,\" she explained. “The second number on the clock is our lifeline, which goes along with our deadline, the top number. The lifeline shows the percentage of renewable energy that we currently have in the world. It's rising at about 5.5% a year on the past year, but it's not rising fast enough to reach zero emissions it the time that we need.\" Israel’s Energy Minister, Karine Elharrar, who was unable to attend the COP26 climate conference Monday because of a lack of wheelchair access, told CNN she has “accepted” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s apology. “He (Boris Johnson) was very kind and very friendly and he apologized. Of course, I accepted and hopefully, it won't happen again,” Elharrar said to CNN's Max Foster during an interview in Glasgow on Tuesday. When asked who she thought was responsible for the issue, Elharrar said she didn’t want to judge. “I just encountered a problem,” she said. “Instead of dealing with green energy, with collaborations between countries in order to fight the climate change, I promoted accessibility,” Elharrar continued.  “I'm not for apologies. I just want for the next time, nothing like that to happen.” Johnson personally apologized to Elharrar for the incident on Monday, according to a senior official with the Israeli delegation at COP. Elharrar, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair, traveled to the COP venue in Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s motorcade on Tuesday and accompanied him into the conference, the official said. Bennett sharply criticized COP 26 organizers for the lack of accessibility and had threatened to cancel his appearance at the event Tuesday.  The president of COP, Alok Sharma, has repeatedly said that a fully inclusive conference was critical to the success of the climate conference. Watch: World leaders and key figures, including Queen Elizabeth II and Sir David Attenborough, opened the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow with stark warnings and encouragements to find a solution to the climate crisis.  On Tuesday, a big contingent pledged efforts to reduce methane emissions. Take a look at what has happened at the summit so far. WATCH: Jon Hales of NGO \"Project Everyone\" is in Glasgow, Scotland, spreading awareness about the UN’s sustainable development goals – a set of commitments to \"leave no one behind\" that were agreed on by all 193 UN member states in 2015. \"It covers everything from poverty, hunger, gender equality, fighting racial injustice, to the climate crisis, to biodiversity to protecting our oceans,” he said. “So we want to raise awareness of the fact that we have this framework, the leaders signed up to it, they've committed to it, we don't need to negotiate on it.” \"Project Everyone\" is pushing for the leaders to include the sustainable development goals into their plans to tackle climate change, Hales said. “We're here to talk about reducing carbon emissions, but we need to do it in a way that is fair and just and takes into account all of the other global goals,” he added. The EU has pledged $1.1 billion to help protect the world's forests.   The landmark figure was announced by European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen in a speech at the COP 26 summit in Glasgow on Tuesday.   As a part of the pledge, $290 million will be reserved for the Congo Basin pledge, a fund established to protect the world’s second largest tropical rainforest against the threats posed by industrial logging and mining.   Von der Leyen made an impassioned case for looking after the world's forests, calling their protection “our shared priority.”   This follows a declaration earlier on Tuesday from over 100 leaders -– accounting for more than 86% of the world’s forests – to work together to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.  Not only do forests safeguard the stability of the climate, they also provide an economic and cultural wealth to millions of people around the world, Von der Leyen said.   A sense of “tradition, culture and craftsmanship” remain “very alive” in forest communities across the globe. The “heritage\" of these communities needs to be protected, she stressed.  “We need to better listen to indigenous communities, producers, consumers and traders. It is crucial for the EU to reduce its “consumption footprint on land and forests around the world,” Von der Leyen said.  To push this forward, the EU will soon propose a regulation designed to address EU-driven global deforestation, according to Von der Leyen.   US President Joe Biden also made a firm pledge on Tuesday to tackle deforestation, placing it on a par with the decarbonization of economies.   US President Joe Biden announced a new clean energy initiative through the launch of the \"First Movers Coalition\" – a platform for building private sector demand to increase innovation in clean energy technology to confront the climate crisis. Here are the details he provided: It is launched in partnership with the World Economic Forum Two dozen of the world's largest and most innovative companies belonging to eight different sectors will participate in it. They represent 30% of the world's global emissions — steel, shipping, aluminum, concrete, trucking, aviation, chemicals and direct air capture. They will push for commercially viable alternatives to decarbonize the industrial sectors, and champion good, paying jobs, Biden said. US President Joe Biden announced an agriculture-focused initiative in partnership with the United Arab Emirates, called Agriculture Innovation Mission, or \"AIM for Climate.\" The mission has gained 75 partners to \"catalyze public and private investment in climate-supported agriculture and food system innovation,\" Biden said Tuesday at COP26. These partners together will launch a $4 billion initial investment globally, with $1 billion contributed by the United States, he added. He invited other world leaders to join and double this investment. Methane — the main component of natural gas — is invisible and odorless, and has 80 times more warming power in the near-term than carbon dioxide. With Earth rapidly approaching the 1.5-degree-Celsius threshold above preindustrial levels, scientists tell CNN that methane emissions need to be reduced fast.  \"The fastest way that we might mitigate some of the climate change that we're seeing already in the short term is by reducing methane,\" Charles Koven, a lead author on August's IPCC report, told CNN. \"If we were to reduce methane emissions, it would act to offset one of these sources of warming.\" If the world stopped emitting carbon dioxide tomorrow, Koven said, global temperatures wouldn't begin to cool for many years because of how long the gas stays in the atmosphere. Reducing methane is the easiest knob to turn to change the path of global temperature in the next 10 years, he said. Methane can be produced in nature from volcanoes and decomposing plant matter, but it is pumped into the atmosphere in much larger amounts by landfills, livestock and the oil and gas industry. Read more: Scientists say this invisible gas could seal our fate on climate change China does “not resist” the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and it is an “achievable target”, the country’s Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said Tuesday. “I do not resist the 1.5 degree target. That is a part of the Paris Agreement goals, actually. Talking about global climate goals needs to be based on rules. Since 1.5 degrees Celsius is a part of the Paris goals, certainly we're not against this target,” Xie Zhenhua said responding directly to a question from CNN during a press conference at COP26 on why China appears to be resisting what scientists say is the crucial target in preserving a liveable planet.  “What I stress here is that the world needs to focus on how to implement this 1.5 degree Celsius target. Whenever we talk about temperature goals, these are goals for the whole world, not for any individual country,\" he added. Earlier in the conference, Zhenhua said “the world already has consensus” on “what people are now saying, keeping 1.5 degrees within reach”. The COP26 climate conference in Glasgow has been described as the last chance to secure this goal. The 2015 Paris Agreement — to which China is party — commits countries to keeping global warming “well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\" according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, who brokered the agreement.   “If we are to only focus on 1.5 degrees, it means that we are destroying this consensus among all parties, and many countries are demanding reopening of negotiations. If we are to change the target to only 1.5 degrees Celsius, that will take a lot of time, it will be quite a long process,\" he told reporters. \"So, what I am saying is that we need to be realistic, to be pragmatic and to correctly interpret the Paris Agreement goals and focus on taking concrete and real actions.” Zhenhua cited China's “special development stage\" for why the country is currently the world’s biggest emitter of CO2. Developing countries such as China, with a per capita GDP of around $10,000, need more time to achieve carbon neutrality, he added.  China aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 and to peak its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Although the country took a major step in September by promising to stop funding coal-fired power stations abroad, it plans to increase its domestic production. Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel.  Zhenhua said China’s goal is to “strictly control” coal consumption in the economic period between 2021 and 2025, and to “gradually reduce our coal consumption” between 2025 and 2030.  Some protesters are trying to express their anger and bewilderment about the climate crisis in more creative ways. Mike Hancock came equipped with an animatronic seagull that is encouraging those heading to the COP26 conference to worry about climate. “We got a piece of street theatre about the SS Planet Titanic where we sing calming songs while people rearrange their deckchairs,” he said, adding that his seagull’s role is to tell people the inconvenient truth. “We are not very optimistic about what’s going on here. It would be great if there was success at the COP, but at the moment, we’re heading for the rocks, I am afraid,” he said. The Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna said the current generation is the last one “that can make a difference” and reverse climate change.  “Our generation is the last generation that can make a difference and turn things around,” Shauna said in an interview with CNN’s Lynda Kinkade on Tuesday. “I think there’s still time to do it.” Shauna went on to say that humanity has all the tools it needs, what’s lacking is the ability to work together.  “We have to agree that we can come together, if we have the political will. And it’s not rocket science to be able to do it,” she explained. “The finance is available, the technology is available, we have knowledge to really do what is needed to prevent a climate crisis.” Approximately 100 countries have signed on to a global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, led by the United States and the European Union. “This is fantastic,” European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen said Tuesday as she announced the news, explaining that slashing methane emissions will have a quick impact. “Doing that will immediately slow down climate change.” “We have to act now,” she explained. “We cannot wait for 2050, we have to cut emissions fast and methane is one of the gases we can cut fastest.” “Cutting back on methane emissions is one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near term global warming and keep 1.5 degrees Celsius. It is the lowest-hanging fruit,” she concluded. Methane — the main component of natural gas — is invisible and odorless, and has 80 times more warming power in the near-term than carbon dioxide. Methane can be produced in nature from volcanoes and decomposing plant matter, but it is leaked into the atmosphere in much larger amounts by landfills, livestock and the oil and gas industry. Scientists tell CNN reducing methane is the easiest way to slow the planet's warming trend. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson personally apologized to Israel’s Energy Minister, Karine Elharrar, who was unable to attend COP26 on Monday because of the lack of wheelchair access to the venue.  Johnson asked Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to invite Elhaarrar to join the two prime ministers in a separate meeting Tuesday. Elharrar, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair, was unable to attend Monday’s proceedings and Johnson personally apologized to her for the incident, according to a senior official with the Israeli delegation at COP. Elharrar traveled to the COP venue in Bennett’s motorcade on Tuesday and was accompanied by the Israeli Prime Minister into the conference, the official said. Bennett sharply criticized the event organizers for the wheelchair-access issue after Monday’s incident, and had threatened to cancel his appearance at the event Tuesday. The president of COP, Minister Alok Sharma has repeatedly said that a fully inclusive conference was critical to the success of the climate conference. Downing Street confirmed to CNN that Johnson had apologized to Elharrar. Climate activists of all ages have descended on Glasgow to demand that world leaders act quickly to combat the climate crisis -- but not all are hopeful that COP26 will lead to concrete pledges. CNN's Ivana Kottasová has spoken with a few of them: Azeez Tobi Abubakar, from Nigeria, and Inés Yabar, from Peru, tell CNN they are in Glasgow to represent the missing majority who cannot attend. They want to amplify the voices of young people who are already feeling the devastating impact of climate change. \"Me being here is a good opportunity to make sure that the voices of those not being here are being heard,\" said Abubakar, who lives in Lagos, a low-lying city on Nigeria's Atlantic coast that is increasingly vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding. Home to more than 24 million people, Lagos may become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise due to climate change, scientific projections suggest. \"To me it’s all about bringing here the voices of the missing majority. The people who cannot come to COP,\" Yabar said of her desire to be at the summit. Both Abubakar and Yabar have access to the main venue and say they will make sure to speak to delegates about the people they represent and experiences with climate change. Gill Phillips, 66, from Bristol, England, came to Glasgow carrying a homemade banner that reads: \"History will judge you.\"  She's not optimistic that history will judge world leaders at COP26 well.  “I think I will be disappointed. The world leaders, they are in office for five, 10 years. They care about getting re-elected, not about the long term. I’m hoping there will be some announcements. But then again, there have been announcements before and nothing happened,\" Phillips said. “We each need to do our bit. I can put my banner up, but there’s not much individuals can do. This is up to the world leaders, corporations, businesses.\" Amelia Ramirez, 67, and Sten-Ivan Bylund, 75, are two members of the “Grandparents for Future,” a Swedish group of elderly people — with or without grandchildren — who want to support young activists in their fight to stop climate change. “We have been supporting Greta Thunberg since, well, pretty much the first day,” Bylund said. The group took the train to Edinburgh and then spent four days walking 40 miles to Glasgow, where they are hoping to have their voices heard. “There’s some hope … if the people there on the other side of this river [at the summit] take strong decisions, there is still hope that we can [stay] below 1.5 degrees,” Bylund said. What steps does he want to see agreed in Glasgow? “Stop subsidizing fossil fuel industries, start to support poor countries that are very heavily affected by climate change,” he told CNN. At the COP26 summit, attendees can find out how much the food they're buying costs and how much greenhouse gas that item has emitted. Take a look:  \"We have partnered with Swedish start up Klimato to analyse the carbon footprint of the food served at COP26,\" the menu website says. \"We will communicate the footprint of each dish on menu boards, informing attendees about what dishes have the lowest impact.\" Each dish is categorized by the food's general carbon footprint: low, medium or high. US President Joe Biden committed to reducing global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 and announced two new proposed US rules in remarks at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.    \"One of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade is to keep 1.5 degrees [Celsius] in reach, is reduce our methane emissions as quickly as possible,\" Biden said. Biden said \"over 80, it's approaching 100 countries\" pledged to accomplish this goal.   \"This is going to make a huge difference. And not just when it comes to fighting climate change as [EU President Ursula von der Leyen] pointed out. Physical health of individuals and whole range of other things. It is going to improve health, reduce asthma, respiratory related emergencies, it's going to improve the food supply as well by cutting crop loss and related ground level pollution. It's going to boost our economies, saving companies money, reducing methane leaks, capturing methane and turn it into new revenue streams and as well as creating good paying union jobs for our workers,\" he said.  Biden announced two new proposals for the US: \"One through our Environmental Protection Agency that is going to reduce methane losses from new and existing oil and gas pipelines. And one through the Department of Transportation to reduce wasteful and potential dangerous leaks from natural gas pipelines.\" Biden also announced a new initiative to work with farmers and ranchers to reduce methane emissions.  \"This isn't just something we have to do to protect the environment of our future, it is an enormous opportunity, enormous opportunity for all of us, all of our nations to create jobs, and make meeting climate goals a core part of our global economic recovery as well,\" he said.  WATCH PRESIDENT BIDEN: Helping to keep the 1.5-degree target alive is Norway's overriding ambition at COP26, the country’s prime minister said in his opening remarks at the climate summit. “This is existential, it is urgent and it is possible if we jointly step up our commitments,” Jonas Gahr Støre said.  Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries committed to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius -- and if possible, below 1.5 degrees Celsius -- by the end of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Prime Minister Støre also said Norway was at the summit with three commitments:  Firstly, the country is ready to double its climate financing contribution to more than $1.6 billion by 2026. “That’s contributing significantly to the hundred billion dollars target set in Paris. And in doing so, we will invite private capital to join us in mobilizing necessary resources,” Støre said. Secondly, the Prime Minister said that his government will prioritize working with business, industry and social partners to “help us all succeed the transition towards renewable, circular and sustainable future.”  “Norway is positioned to take a lead in developing ocean-based solutions such as offshore wind, green shipping, carbon capture utilisation and storage, hydrogen and electrical mobility,” he added. Støre said his country's third point is a warning that the financial sector must play its part. “Norway’s public pension fund is the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Our goal is to make it the leading fund in responsible investment, and the management of climate risk. Climate risk is indeed a financial risk, and it needs to be managed as such.” Beijing’s special envoy on climate change has said that China has been leading investment in renewable energy. “For the past eight years China has been number one in terms of investment in renewable energy. Because of our efforts in developing renewable energy, the cost has been driven down largely now,” Xie Zhenhua said. “Renewable energy is competitive compared to conventional energy resources in China, and with our continuous efforts, the cost continue to go down.” China, the world's biggest polluter, has made only a small improvement in its emission-cutting plan formally submitted to the United Nations last Thursday, just days before the start of COP26. In the new plan -- known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) -- China said it aimed to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and reach net zero by 2060, a pledge that President Xi Jinping had previously announced. It added that China would lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% from the 2005 level by 2030.  US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said Tuesday there is \"something different\" happening at the COP26 climate summit taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, pointing to a level of engagement by world leaders and a sense of urgency that he hasn't seen at previous United Nations climate summits. \"There is something bigger, more engaged, more urgent in what is happening here than I have seen in at any other COP, and I believe we are going to come up with record levels of ambition,\" Kerry told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Tuesday. The gathering in Glasgow is the 26th annual conference of parties (COP) brought together by the United Nations to address climate change.  Kerry said he believes it is possible to reach the goal that world leaders agreed to at COP21 in 2015 – also known as the Paris Agreement – of holding global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, and if possible, 1.5 degrees Celsius. \"I believe that if people do what they've laid out as their specific plans, yes,\" Kerry told Amanpour when asked if he still thought 1.5 degrees Celsius was still an achievable target.  The former secretary of state continued: \"Is it hard? You're right, it's damn hard. It's very hard, but it is better to push for that. It's better to make that your target.\" The prevailing scientific consensus is that temperatures can rise 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels before the most catastrophic changes – increasingly devastating fires, floods and droughts – begin to occur. But significant questions remain about whether some of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, including China and India, will get on board.   Programming note: Watch the full interview with John Kerry with Christiane Amanpour on CNN's \"Amanpour\" at 2 p.m. ET/6 p.m. GMT The issue of whether wealthy industrialized countries should pay for the damage already caused by climate change is a key sticking point at the COP26 talks. Poorer nations hit by the worst impacts of climate change have been pushing for climate reparations for years, they say they depend on them for their survival. So far, the financing promised to them under the Paris Agreement is meant to be used to transition their economies and prepare for future climate change, but not for dealing with the damage already done. Negotiators from two European countries told CNN the issue is high on the agenda and will be discussed in several sessions. “There’s a push for this and it will be part of discussions around finance and [the Paris Agreement] process,” one negotiator said, adding that there is a push to make the issue a permanent agenda item. However, there is a strong opposition against the idea. Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, told CNN he can’t see firm commitments being made at this conference and said that he was pursuing other avenues for climate justice.  Browne aded that Antigua and Barbuda and Tuvalu have set up a special commission on climate change and international law to explore legal options for small island nations to make wealthy, greenhouse gas-emitting countries \"pay for loss and damage.\" “That commission will take on the issue of loss and damage in the international courts as we seek to get climate justice. We have the view that he who pollutes must pay,” he said. Western nations won't deliver on a $100 billion climate financing promise to developing nations until 2022 or 2023, China’s special envoy on climate change Xie Zhenhua said Tuesday.  I recently talked to the top COP26 president Alok Sharma and with John Kerry and ministers for many other countries. And they told me that we need to wait until 2022 or even 2023 to achieve the target 100 billion US dollars, the target set for before 2020,” he told reporters at the COP26 summit. \n“However, they failed to deliver on their commitment before 2020 which has a negative impact on the mutual trust between developed and developing countries.” Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich countries made a significant pledge: to provide $100 billion a year in finance to less wealthy nations by 2020, in order to help them cope with climate change. That target was missed last year and a large gap remains. Experts say $100 billion a year isn't even enough to begin with. It's a key sticking point at the talks in Glasgow. Prior to COP26, only a small number of developed nations were paying their fair share on climate financing for poorer countries, according to independent think tank ODI. Xie, who served as China's chief negotiator during key climate meetings in Copenhagen and Paris, said discussions with COP26 President Sharma were “highly constructive,” but cautioned that “huge gaps” still remained. “There should be a balance between mitigation and adaptation,” Xie said.  The US, UK, France, Germany and European Union will help fund South Africa's transition away from coal, in a multilateral effort that could serve as a model for other developing nations to ditch the fossil fuel. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the initial $8.5 billion partnership would help South Africa to decarbonize its coal intensive energy system. The details of the specific funding were not announced, and diplomats expect the fine print to be worked out in the months ahead.    US President Joe Biden stressed that trillions in public and private funding will be needed to help the developing world move away from fossil fuels. By assisting and responding to the needs of developing countries, rather than dictating projects from afar we can deliver the greatest impact for those who need it the most,\" he said.   Climate scientists and some diplomats say the South Africa agreement could pave the way for similar deals with other heavily-polluting developing countries -- a critical step in containing global warming and avoiding a full-blown climate catastrophe. The promise to finance a transition from coal will be noticed by politicians in developing nations because South Africa is among the most coal-dependent nations in the world. One of the heaviest polluters on the planet:  Nearly 90% of South Africa's power generation is fueled by coal, making the country one of the heaviest polluters per-capita on the planet. South Africa's Mpumalanga province is home to most of the country's coal industry and coal-fired power stations, with their colossal chimneys, flanking both sides of the highway. Recently, the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air judged Eskom -- which has a monopoly on power in South Africa -- to be the world's most-polluting power company. It spews more deadly sulfur dioxide than the US, Europe and even China's power sectors.   Read more about South Africa's phaseout of coal here: Climate Envoy John Kerry has told CNN that the United States is working closely with China, the world’s largest CO2 emitter, on its commitment to transition away from fossil fuels.  Speaking from the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Kerry told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that the US is working with China “without challenging them in any personal way.”  “China has said we are going to strictly limit coal,” Kerry said. “What we are trying to do is work with China in a cooperative way to show how they could speed up the transition.” Chinese President Xi Jinping is not attending the summit in Glasgow and Amanpour pressed Kerry on how serious the Chinese commitment is when it comes to reducing the country’s reliance on coal.  “They have issued instructions to their provinces, to the leaders in various parts of the country, that they have to adhere to a certain standard. That standard, we don’t think is big enough, is strong enough,” Kerry told CNN. “We don’t know yet where we are with that … they will need to transition off of coal faster.” Despite the lack of a clear commitment from Beijing, former Secretary of State Kerry said that he believes the Chinese ultimately will commit to a faster transition. “The climate issue is as existential to China as it is to us. It’s as critical to Chinese citizens as it is to us. They want to be rid of pollution. They want cleaner air. They want a healthier life.” Kerry told Amanpour that Xi and President Joe Biden have agreed to meet on the issue at an undetermined future date.   On Saturday, Biden urged major G20 energy producing countries with spare capacity to boost their production of oil and gas to meet global demand.  When Amanpour pointed out the disconnect between that and the commitments that the US was trying to make at the COP26 summit, Kerry pushed back. “We are where we are in our economies, in the global marketplace. You can’t just shut it off … you need to stabilize the marketplace, bring the prices down, and empower us to be able to make this transition in an orderly and just way,” he said. “We don’t want workers to suddenly be thrown out and all of a sudden, your economies are cratering,” he added.  Some background: Kerry helped to negotiate the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement while serving in the Obama administration -- an agreement that the US subsequently withdrew from during the presidency of Donald Trump.  Amanpour posed the question as to whether the US could be taken seriously on its pledges by global partners. Kerry retorted that the changing global economy meant that climate commitments made by the US were not reversible by any one leader.   “90% of the electricity that has come online in the United States in the last few years, in the globe in fact, on the planet, has come from renewables,” he said.  “That’s not reversible from any one politician. It is not reversible,” he added.  Madagascar is in the grips of drought and famine, and failing to act to stop climate change will have disastrous consequences for the country, Andry Rajoelina, the president of the African island, has warned. Failure is not an option, we must succeed for us, for our nation and for our planet. The Earth, which has given us everything, is asking us today that we save our planet,”  Rajoelina told an audience at COP26.  \n“These consequences are disastrous, particularly for the south of Madagascar, which is facing famine caused by climate change,” he added. People in the country's south are living through the worst drought in 40 years, according to the UN World Food Programme, and more than 1.3 million people in Madagascar are experiencing food distress. My compatriots are bearing the brunt of a climate crisis not of their own making,” Rajoelina said, underlining the undue burden that developing nations face as a result of emissions in the developed world. He also highlighted that deforestation was among the country’s biggest concerns.  “Every year, 3.9 million hectares of forests disappear in Africa. The main drivers of this deforestation is the use and processing of wood into charcoal,” Rajoelina said, adding that 90% of African households still use charcoal to cook their food.  \"To obtain 10 kilos of charcoal, you need 100 kilos of wood, so you can imagine, every year, one family destroys one hectare of forests to meet their own needs. So how can we stop this disaster?” the president said.  Despite the grim reality, Rajoelina went on to speak about the country’s current plan of financing alternative solutions, which would replace charcoal in favor of stoves that run on bio ethanol and biogas in order to preserve the forests. He also urged global leaders to act. “I call on leaders from around the world to accelerate the mobilization of $100 billion for the Paris agreement so that we can fund energy transition policy in Africa,” Rajoelina added.  Away from the world leaders, on the public side of the COP26 summit venue, there's lots of fun activities and displays going on, aimed at educating people about climate issues.  CNN's Ivana Kottasová takes a look. Amid all the big news out of Glasgow, including pledges to cut back on methane emissions and end deforestation by the end of the decade, a passing moment is drawing some attention — US President Biden appearing to nod off during the opening session of COP26. Biden, who has been traveling overseas for days, was seen closing his eyes for an extended period of time and rubbing his eyes during COP26's opening session. He went on to deliver a major speech for about 10 minutes shortly after the moment. The President is expected to hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday before returning to the United States with an expected arrival on Wednesday. The President of the western Pacific island of Palau urged world leaders to act aggressively against climate change before island nations completely disappear. Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful death. You might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer only to witness our slow and fateful demise,\" President Surangel Whipps Jr. said. \"We are drowning and our only hope is the life ring you are holding. You must act now.\" Asking for equitable access to climate financing and viable technological transfer, he added: \"We, the islands that are devastated most, demand that your commitments of $100 billion annually be increased to meet the $4 trillion the World Bank reports is needed.\" In pre-recorded video statements, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a slew of other world leaders voiced their support for a declaration to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030 -- the first big win of the the COP26 climate talks. More than 100 leaders, whose countries collectively account for more than 85% of the world's forests, have agreed to the declaration, which could potentially put a huge dent in global emissions. Among the nations taking part are Canada, Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all of which have significant tracts of forest. Brazil in particular has come under criticism for allowing an increase in the deforestation of the Amazon in recent years. The United States and China will also be party to the agreement. In hailing the agreement on forests and land use, many of the leaders noted the key role that forests play in their nations -- in their society, culture and climate future. \"Our country accounts for around 20% of the world's forestland,\" Putin said, adding that Russia had approved a long-term government climate strategy on Monday targeting carbon neutrality by 2060. \"We take the strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve it.\" Bolsonaro, who has been criticized for rainforest reduction on his watch, urged every country to \"help defend all forests, committing adequate resources, for the benefit of all.\" Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said that forests mattered to him on a personal level. \"In fact, I make many of my decisions and thinking while walking in the forest. So not only do we need good policies for forest, we also need forests for good policy decisions.\" While the world leaders remain confined to the plenary rooms, the spirit of the COP26 climate summit is obvious all across the host city of Glasgow. There are signs boasting about its net zero target and campaigns encouraging people to walk, cycle or take a train. There are also numerous events and exhibits raising awareness of climate change and the difficulties it brings being held around Scotland's biggest city.  Here’s a vertical farm demonstration, highlighting the challenges of growing food in our changing climate. Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos has pledged $2 billion to directly restoring nature and transforming food systems as parts of the Bezos Earth Fund's $10 billion commitment to \"fight climate change, enhance nature and advance environmental justice and economic opportunity.\" Making the announcement at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, he said: \"We must conserve what we still have, we must restore what we've lost, and we must grow what we need to live without degrading the planet for future generations to come.\" Bezos said his space flight reminded him that nature is fragile, the Earth is finite and the atmosphere is thin. This comes as world leaders at the summit have emphasized the need of private sector to play a greater role in climate action. Gabon President Ali Bongo Ondimba presented a stark warning to the global leaders present at the COP26 summit in Glasgow on Tuesday, saying, \"The doors to the future our closing.\" \"IPCC [the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] tells us there is no valuable future without the tropical rainforests. This is my hope that Glasgow will mark a turning point,\" Ondimba added. The leader of the Central African nation invited world leaders to invest responsibly in Gabon's forests and urged them to stand by the country in its \"efforts to protect and understand our forest's ecosystem.\" Ending on a hopeful note, Ondimba concluded: \"Together, we [can] keep our forests standing and the door open for our children and their children.\" “Climate change and biodiversity loss are two sides of the same coin,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday as he took to the stage at the first ever COP world leaders’ session on forest and land use. “We can’t deal with the devastating loss of habitats and species without tackling climate change, and we can’t deal with climate change without protecting our natural environment and protecting the rights of indigenous people who are its stewards,” Johnson said. “We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests.” The event launched a declaration from over 100 leaders -- accounting for more than 85% of the world’s forests -- to work together to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. Johnson stressed the particular significance of £5.3 billion ($7.2 billion) of private investment in the pledge in “supporting sustainable jobs” -- alongside £8.75 billion ($12 billion) of public funds. “As we sign this declaration today, let’s also galvanize a radical shift in public and private finance. Let’s channel funds towards securing the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.”  Joining the UK Prime Minister on stage was Columbian President Iván Duque Márquez, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, co-director of the pavilion of the World Indigenous Peoples’ Initiative. “I am very glad that this climate negotiation has started to consider that nature and forests have a key role to play in meeting the objective of the Paris Agreement,” said Oumarou Ibrahim. “It's took your 25 COPs to understand that indigenous peoples have known forever [that] our planet is a life … Indigenous peoples have a PhD in afforestation and sustainable management of land. Even though we represent only 5% of the world's population, we protect 80% of the remaining biodiversity.” Further to the declaration on deforestation, 28 governments, representing 75% of global trade in key commodities that can threaten forests, have signed up to a new Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Statement.  “There is no value in making [a] beautiful speech here about deforestation if at home you let the private sector steal indigenous peoples’ land or destroy the ecosystem,'' Oumarou Ibrahim added. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that over 10 countries, the Bezos Earth Fund and the European Union have signed the Congo Basin Pledge which will mobilize over $1.5 billion to protect forests, peatlands and other critical carbon stores. \"I'm delighted to announce at this summit, that the world is coming together around their effort ... with at least $1.5 billion over the next five years to help protect the ... precious ecosystems of Central Africa,\" Johnson said, underlining the work of the presidents of the Republic of Congo and Gabon. Johnson added that the funds were part of a new global forest finance pledge of over $12 billion, which he said amounted to \"the biggest collective commitment of public funds for forest and climate action in history.\" Earlier, the British government said that more than 100 world leaders representing over 85% of the planet's forests would commit on Tuesday to ending and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030 -- the first substantial deal announced at the COP26 climate talks. \"Let's end this great global chainsaw massacre by making conservation do what we know it can do, and that is deliver long-term sustainable jobs and growth as well. And today is not just a vital win in the struggle to contain global temperature increases, it's also a huge economic opportunity, and this is the long-term sustainable path to ending the loss of our forests, protecting our sacred biodiversity, and helping to keep alive the ambition of 1.5 degrees by the end of the century,\" Johnson said. President Joe Biden announced a new plan to conserve global forests on the second day of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, in the first major deal to break at the talks.  “Today I’m announcing a new plan to conserve global forest, which will bring together a full range of US government tools, diplomatic, financial and policy to halt forests loss, restore critical carbon sinks, and improve land management,” Biden said.  The President said: “Conserving our forest and other critical ecosystems is indispensable, an indispensable piece of keeping our climate goals within reach, as well as many other key priorities that we have together: ensuring clean water, maintaining biodiversity, supporting rural and indigenous communities and reducing the risk of the spread of disease.\" “Forests have the potential to reduce, reduce carbon globally by more than one third. By more than one third. So we need to approach this issue with the same seriousness of purpose as decarbonizing our economies. That's what we're doing in the United States,\" Biden said.  Here is what happened during the first full day of the UN's COP26 climate summit: A deal on forests: More than 100 world leaders representing over 85% of the planet's forests committed to ending and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030, in an agreement that will be officially announced Tuesday, a British government statement says. \nIt's the first  substantial deal announced at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow after a gloomy start. Among the nations taking part are Canada, Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all of which have significant tracts of forest. The US and China will also be party to the agreement. Biden's apology: President Joe Biden apologized to his fellow world leaders that the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration.\n\"I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact that the United States — the last administration — pulled out of the Paris Accords and put us sort of behind the 8 ball,\" Biden said in Glasgow.\nBiden reentered the agreement just hours after he was sworn into office in January. The UK wheels out the big names: The UK government, which is hosting the UN climate summit in Glasgow, has tried its best to press it upon world leaders that now is the time to act on climate\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told his fellow heads of governments that they can be just like James Bond, the famous (albeit fictional) 007 agent and save the world from a ticking (climate) bomb.\nRoyalty — both real and of the TV variety — was also in attendance, with Prince Charles urging leaders to work together, and the celebrated naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough telling them future generations would judge them by their actions during this conference.\nLater in the day, Queen Elizabeth II welcomed world leaders in a video address played during a reception. India makes net-zero promise: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made headlines on Monday by announcing a net-zero emissions target, pledging India will become carbon neutral by 2070.\nWhile it was a major announcement, as India had not yet put a date on its net-zero ambition, the 2070 target is a decade later than China's, and two decades after the world as a whole needs to achieve net-zero emissions in order to avoid temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. But experts say that because of India's economic development and energy mix, the target date should not be compared to those of the US or Europe. Small nations' disappointment: Delegates from smaller nations have expressed their disappointment with the action (or rather, lack of action) by the world's richest nations. Covid-19 measures hampering the negotiations: All attendees have been asked to wear masks and take daily coronavirus tests. And while the COP26 venue is huge (approximately 1 kilometer from one end to the other), the sheer number of people on site makes Covid-19 social distancing difficult.\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body that is in charge of the negotiations, has admitted the pandemic is causing issues. For example, due to social distancing, the largest room reserved for negotiations can only hold 144 seats -- even though there are 193 parties to be represented at the conference. Read more about the takeaways here: More than 100 world leaders representing over 85% of the planet's forests will commit on Tuesday to ending and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030, a British government statement says, in what would be the first substantial deal announced at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. Among the nations taking part are Canada, Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all of which have significant tracts of forest. Brazil in particular has come under criticism for allowing an increase in the deforestation of the Amazon in recent years. The US and China will also be party to the agreement. The deal is consequential to the climate as forests, when they are logged or degrade, emit carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, accounting for around 11% of the world's total CO2 emissions. The leaders will make the announcement during a COP26 session about forests and commit £8.75 billion ($12 billion) of public funds to protection and restoration, alongside £5.3 billion ($7.2 billion) of private investment. CEOs from more than dozens of financial institutions, including Aviva, Schroders and Axa, are also committing to ending investment in activities that lead to deforestation. The agreement will likely provide a morale boost at COP26, which got off to shaky start after the G20 leaders' summit in Rome over the weekend failed to result in an agreement on firm new climate commitments, particularly on when to end the use of coal. It is also a breakthrough after years of negotiations on how to protect forests.  Read more on the deal here: The world leaders summit at the COP26 conference in Glasgow continues on Tuesday, with the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari among those scheduled to speak.  But while the world leaders are speaking on the stage, the real negotiations are under way in meeting rooms down the corridor where representatives of the 193 signatories of the Paris Agreement are trying to find a consensus on how the deal should be enforced.  Here are some of the items they are trying to achieve: An agreement on more aggressive emission reductions over this decade\nPutting an end date on the use of coal\nProviding $100 billion in annual climate financing\nMaking all new car sales zero emissions within 14-19 years\nEnding and reversing deforestation by the end of the decade\nReducing emissions from methane Climate negotiations are always tricky, which is why the delegates have two whole weeks to find solutions.  Even then, it is far from certain they will be able to reach an agreement. Previous COP conferences in Katowice in 2018 and Madrid in 2019 failed to reach a deal on some of the thorniest issues. President Biden apologized to other world leaders on Monday for the Trump administration's decision to exit the Paris climate agreement, saying during the United Nations' climate summit that the US' exit put the country behind in its climate goals. \"I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact that the United States -- the last administration pulled out of the Paris accord. It put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,\" the President said during a session on \"action and solidarity\" at the summit in Glasgow. The President announced the US would rejoin the Paris accords hours after he was sworn into office in January. During the session, Biden also said \"the American people, four or five years ago, weren't at all sure about climate change, whether it was real.\" \"Well, they have, as they say in southern parts of my state, 'seen the lord.' They've seen what's happened back home. The incredible changes that are taking place. And they're now finally ... seeing the sense of urgency that you all are,\" Biden continued. In his earlier opening remarks at the summit, Biden issued a plea and a warning to global leaders to take forceful action on climate change, even as his own climate ambitions hang in the balance. \"Right now, we're still falling short. There's no time to hang back, sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves,\" Biden said. \"This is the challenge of our collective lifetime -- the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases. So let this be the moment that we answer history's call here in Glasgow.\" There's a lot of technical lingo to get a grasp of if you're following COP26.  One buzzword you may have heard a lot: Net zero.  Net zero emissions can be achieved by removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as what's emitted, so the net amount added is zero.  To do this, countries and companies will need to rely on natural methods — like planting trees or restoring grasslands — to soak up carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas we emit, or use technology to \"capture\" the gas and store it away where it won't escape into the atmosphere. Dozens of countries have already pledged to achieve net zero by mid-century and there is huge pressure on countries that haven't yet to do so at COP26. Here are other terms to know to keep up with the talks, understand what's at stake and, most importantly, sound smart around the dinner table: US President Joe Biden is entering the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, with a message of urgency and what he hopes is a convincing-enough plan to make good on his promise to cut US greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. He arrived Monday morning with a message to leaders that his word is good when it comes to following through on his climate commitments. Biden's challenge this week is convincing fellow leaders that the United States will remain committed to the cause, and to cajole them to do more themselves. \"We think this is the decisive decade, the decade of decision, the decade of action. And it is critical that countries lay out long term plans,\" said John Kerry, the US envoy for climate change, on the eve of the summit. Kerry has laid out four main goals for the United States at the Scotland talks:  Raising global ambition on containing a rise in temperatures\nGetting countries to commit to taking action this decade\nDriving ahead on finance and adaptation efforts to vulnerable communities\nCompleting negotiations on implementation guidelines for the Paris Climate accord Biden will be carrying with him significant private sector commitments designed to bolster his pitch, as well as the willingness to aid smaller countries with the financing and technical expertise they may lack. Biden had once hoped to arrive in Glasgow having passed a signature spending package containing the biggest-ever US investment in combatting climate change, a signal to the world he was serious about reducing greenhouse gasses.  He fell short of that, announcing only a framework plan in the hours before he departed for Europe last week. The bills have yet to be voted upon as Democrats continue haggling over the timing. It's just the latest example global players can point to as reason for skepticism after more than three decades of watching the US leadership pendulum swing back and forth on an increasingly urgent and dire issue. Still, it appears likely the sweeping social legislation will pass eventually, perhaps as soon as this week. And even as the bill was stripped of major liberal priorities and shrank from $3.5 trillion to $1.75 trillion, it retained the originally imagined $555 billion in climate and clean energy provisions, the largest single legislative investment on climate in American history. COP is short for the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change, which is an event that takes place annually, though it was postponed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. World leaders do attend, but a lot of the discussions take place among ministers and other high-level officials working on climate issues. The 26 signifies that this is the group's 26th meeting. The conferences are massive events with a lot of side meetings that attract people from the business sector, fossil fuel companies, climate activists and other groups with a stake in the climate crisis. Some of them are successful — the Paris Agreement was hammered out during COP21, for example — and some are painfully unproductive. More than 190 countries signed onto the Paris Agreement after the COP21 meeting in 2015, to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. Half a degree may not sound like a huge difference, but scientists say any additional warming past 1.5 degrees will trigger more intense and frequent climate extremes. For example, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, according to the UN. Scientists see 2 degrees as a critical threshold where extreme weather would render some of the world's most densely populated areas into uninhabitable deserts or flood them with sea water. Although the Paris Agreement was a landmark moment in the quest to address the climate crisis, it didn't include details on how the world would achieve its goal. The subsequent COPs have sought to make the plans attached to it more ambitious and to detail courses of action. \"On paper, the Paris Agreement was always designed as a cyclical process — 'see you in five years, with better plans and renewed efforts,'\" said Lola Vallejo, the climate program director at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations. \"So right now, we are at this deadline, pushed back by Covid.\" Read more about COP26 here.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211101084729-cop-26-britain-us-biden-johnson-glasgow-un-110121-story-body.jpg"}

Many of the protests against the pipeline have been centered in Minnesota, where it passes bodies of water including the mouth of the Mississippi River. If the pipeline becomes fully operational, Line 3 will carry about 760,000 barrels of Canadian oil each day from North Dakota to Wisconsin.  Tokata Iron Eyes, 18, who marched at the strike in New York, said she’s representing young Indigenous peoples and ancestors who couldn’t show up and fight for the planet today. Iron Eyes said she is calling on US leaders to put an end to fossil fuel subsidies, halt the Line 3 pipeline, and redact the permits for the Dakota Access pipeline in South Dakota.  “Because our communities have refused to exploit our resources ourselves, we are now in a position where we are in the global front lines who are bearing the brunt of the consequences of human-caused climate crisis,” Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, told CNN.  Some context: Despite sweeping climate pledges, including a recent one on limiting methane — a major component of natural gas — the Biden administration has defended a key decision that was made in the last days of the Trump administration to issue those permits. But it could still withdraw the federal permits that are allowing the pipeline to move forward, and that’s what youth climate activists were calling for in their speeches today.  “People are starting to realize the severity of the situation, climate activists like myself who have been doing this since we were 8 years old are now becoming adults and dealing with the same thing we are talking about since we were children — its a travesty,” Iron Eyes said. Iron Eyes said the tides are changing with the youth climate movement in that it is becoming more diverse and spotlighting more Indigenous issues.  “Being there and representing so much more than just one person and understanding that presence in itself opens so many doors,” she said. “The visibility was important for me.” Youth climate activists marched in New York City today to call for climate justice and to put an end to the burning of fossil fuels.  As strikers made their way down to Lower Manhattan’s financial district, stopping New York City traffic, the bustling streets filled with chants like “sea levels are rising, so are we,” “Keep that carbon in the soil,” and “There’s nothing natural about natural gas.”  The path followed the same route as 2019’s larger climate strike when Greta Thunberg made an appearance. Among the faces in the march toward Battery Park, where the crowd heard from speakers and musicians, were prominent youth activists such as Alexandria Villaseñor, Jerome Foster II, and Jamie Margolin.  Villanseñor told CNN her goals have evolved since she started striking at 13. She has been striking every Friday in front of the United Nations headquarters in New York since December 2018 until the pandemic lockdowns began. “The movement has really changed in the past year or so,” she said. “The climate crisis is continuing to get more urgent. In the latest UN climate report that came out in August, the language changed to more be urgent, saying that we are already impacted, and that now we just have to mitigate. It was prevent before, but now we have to mitigate.” Foster, currently the youngest member serving on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, told CNN he was wearing red to represent the findings of the landmark UN state-of-the-science report on climate change, which has been called a “code red for humanity.” “Our demands have changed. We’re not just kids that are just out in the streets anymore, we now in positions of authority,” he said. “Now we’re being taken seriously, we have a seat at the table, we’re gonna make sure that everyone in that table understand the pressing urgency and take action.” Margolin, co-founder of the climate organization Zero Hour who joined the movement in 2016, was also wearing red to represent a world on fire. She grew up in the Pacific Northwest, which this summer experienced a record-shattering heat wave that scientists say would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change.  “It’s been such a long journey, and it’s really overwhelming in a good way to see such joy ands resilience right now because it’s been such a dark time for so long,” she told CNN. “Online activism is just not the same, especially with so much climate disasters happening.” The theme for today’s Global Climate Strike is “Uproot The System” which is meant to spotlight the most climate-vulnerable communities.  Organizers say uprooting the system means addressing the historical legacies of injustice that exacerbate the most severe impacts of the climate crisis.  “The current system actively strives towards highlighting the voices of the most privileged through a racist and white-savior narrative that portrays people from the Global South as underdeveloped, poor, and voiceless,” organizers said. Against the backdrop of the UN General Assembly, climate activists are calling on developed nations to not only rapidly slash greenhouse gas emissions, but to also push for climate financing toward helping developing countries from being left behind.  Wealthier nations are the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the planet, yet vulnerable communities such as small island nations and Indigenous peoples feel most of its consequences. These countries also disproportionately suffer the most severe impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “We cannot allow the world to continue to ignore the social impacts of the climate crisis, because all social inequalities are exacerbated when climate and environmental conditions impact local communities,” activists say. Climate activists in Istanbul staged a \"die in\" outside the city's Gazhane Museum.  The protests are part of thousands of rallies scheduled around the world alongside the United Nations General Assembly and as part of Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future climate movement. Today's rallies mark the first climate strike in Turkey since Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan announced at the UN on Tuesday that Turkey will bring the Paris Agreement to parliament for approval next month ahead of COP26. Here's what it looked like outside of the museum: Emine Ozkan, co-spokesperson of Turkey's Green Party, welcomed President Tayyip Erdogan's announcement this week that Turkey will bring the Paris Agreement to parliament for approval next month ahead of COP26.  \"Until Tuesday, Turkey was one of the six countries that did not ratify Paris Climate Agreement together with Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Yemen,\" Ozkan said. \"We, the Greens, and the climate movement in Turkey have been fighting for years for this outcome. Our struggle and the interest in climate politics, especially the Paris Climate Agreement in the international arena, did not allow Turkey to resist any longer.\" ​​\"Issues such as the floods and wild fires we have suffered this year, the economic crisis we have been through, youth unemployment and access to the right to housing, which has become more visible recently, are pressing the government from every angle,\" she told CNN at a climate rally in Istanbul Friday. \"We need to see that ratifying the Paris climate agreement is the beginning, not the end. Turkey has a lot of work ahead of it. First of all, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets should be updated realistically in line with the 1.5 degree target. After this update, strategic plans should be made on how the reduction will take place in all policy areas, and Turkey should set a target year in order to be carbon neutral,\" she continued. \"As the opposition parties, we must closely monitor and audit all processes and put pressure on taking bold steps. Because we have no time to lose! Our house is on fire,\" Ozkan added. Members of Climate Action Network (CAN) have reacted to the 76th UN General Assembly that took place in New York this week. Over the week, world leaders addressed the climate crisis and announced their agendas for the upcoming year, but CAN members argue they are not doing enough. With weeks to go until the Cop26 climate summit, members of the group, including 1,500 NGOs in more than 130 countries, are calling on world leaders to work together to tackle the climate crisis. \"Today, millions go to the streets to tell leaders they cannot fake climate action with empty rhetoric. The US’ announcement on climate finance and China’s announcement on coal are essential but they are not enough,” Eddy Pérez, international climate diplomacy manager with Climate Action Network Canada said in a statement on Friday. Following Friday’s youth climate strikes, Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a Fridays for Future activist from the Philippines, highlighted a key message from their #UprootTheSystem campaign, telling rich countries they have a “climate debt to humanity.” Biden has pledged $100 billion towards climate funding before COP26, however Cansin Leylim, associate director of global campaigns at 350.org, said that it is not enough.  “To ensure that the global temperature stays below 1.5°C degrees, trillions of dollars are required. The USA should pay its fair share,” said Leylim. Young people in Istanbul want more to be done to tackle climate change. \"We faced the striking results of climate crisis in Turkey and all over the world recently,\" university student Yaren Ozcan told CNN. The country suffered some of the worst wildfires in its history this summer followed by heavy flash floods across Turkish Black Sea provinces, that killed dozens of people in the north. \"We are the last generation to change this wrong path,\" the 21-year old said. \"This is an international day. We got together in Istanbul but there are strikes in other cities in Turkey. We are here to make our voices heard and for climate emergency awareness,\" she added. \"It is a hopeful development that Turkey announced it will ratify Paris,\" Ozcan said referencing Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan's announcement at the UN Tuesday that Turkey will bring the Paris Agreement to parliament for approval next month ahead of COP26.  \"We were surprised to hear while getting ready for today. We are happy, and will keep following its application close,\" she added. Founder of the Fridays for Future movement, Greta Thunberg, is addressing crowds of protesters in Berlin – two days before Germany goes to the polls. \"Theres no going back now, we can still turn this around, people are ready for change, we want change, we demand change and we are the change,\" Thunberg said. The country has the highest number of youth protests planned for Friday, with more than 400 scheduled to take place. \"Yes, we must vote, you must vote, but remember that voting only will not be enough. We must keep going into the streets,\" Thunberg said that in direct reference to Sunday's election. \"(It’s not an overstatement to say) They simply don’t give a damn about us,\" she said talking about German politicians and political parties. \"We need to become all climate activists and we need to uproot the system,\" Thunberg added. Watch:  Climate activists in Istanbul are holding a vegan picnic to start their protests against the climate crisis. Images from the picnic show youth activists sitting on blankets, eating food and holding signs calling for action. It is the first climate strike since the Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan announced at the UN on Tuesday that Turkey will bring the Paris Agreement to parliament for approval next month ahead of COP26. Turkey signed the Paris agreement in 2016 but was one of the six countries that did not ratify it, along with Eritrea, İran, Iraq, Libya, Yemen. This is a big step forward, but many activists are still calling for further action. Turkey is vulnerable to climate change, and this summer saw some of the worst wildfires in the country's history. Soon after, heavy flash floods swept across Turkish Black Sea provinces, killing dozens of people in the north. Canadian youth climate activist and filmmaker Slater Jewell-Kemker premiered her feature documentary “Youth Unstoppable” on Thursday night, ahead of Friday's global protests. Jewell-Kemker began chronicling the stories of young climate activists around the world at 15 years old. After years of filming and meeting young people from Nepal to Paris and Japan, her documentary shows the authenticity of the evolution of the youth climate movement.  “Over the past 15 years, the movement has changed a lot and has come into its own and challenged its own identity of being a youth movement,” she told CNN. “Some of the most meaningful things I've seen are how diverse it's become, how Indigenous leaders and young people and voices are becoming more and more the core and the heart of this movement.”  Like many climate activists today, her journey into activism began after she watched the climate documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" at a young age and grew frustrated with the lack of action.  “I wasn't sure how I could be involved. I wasn't necessarily going to be the kid who went out and chained herself to a reactor refinery,” she said. “But I had a camera and I knew how to talk to people and ask them questions. And so for me, it felt like that was how I could be a part of the movement, how I could be an activist. And it just kind of grew from there.”  Jewell-Kemker said she joined the climate protests in Paris in 2015 and was injured when police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons on the Champs-Elysées. “I felt so overwhelmed, I felt so terrified by this story of how we're in this really horrific point in time, and it doesn't seem like most people are doing anything about it,” she said.  “And it really felt like here is an older generation, coming in and saying ‘this is what the rest of your life will be like,’ and I felt like I had no say in my future.” After Thursday's global premiere of \"Youth Unstoppable,\" Jewell-Kemker told CNN she felt relieved, after the many years that went into making it.  \"Young people need to be reminded that they are part of something bigger than ourselves and that we do have the power to change things,\" she said. Her documentary is currently being shown for free on WaterBear, a streaming platform focused on climate change, biodiversity and nature. It will also be screened at the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, this November. At the United Nations General Assembly meeting of world leaders on Tuesday, Secretary General António Guterres sounded the alarm on climate crisis, saying that the world is \"moving in the wrong direction.\" The window to keep the Paris Climate agreement's goals alive is \"rapidly closing,\" he warned. \"Climate scientists tell us it is not too late to keep alive the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Climate Agreement. But the window is rapidly closing. We need a 45% cut in emissions by 2030. Yet a recent UN report made clear that with present national climate commitments, emissions will go up by 16% by 2030.\" \"That would condemn us to a hellscape of temperature rises of at least 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a catastrophe,\" he added. Looking ahead at the upcoming UN Climate Conference in Glasgow, Guterres said the world is \"seemingly light years away from reaching our targets.\" Highlighting that the OECD reported a gap of at least $20 billion in essential and promised climate finance to developing countries, he outlined his recommendations and called on multiple stakeholders to escalate the momentum in global action against climate change, especially in the areas of mitigation, finance and adaptation. Countries should commit to carbon neutrality by mid-century, and to concrete 2030 emissions reductions targets that will get us there, backed up with credible actions now.\nDeveloping nations should finally see the promised $100 billion a year for climate action, fully mobilizing the resources of both international financial institutions and the private sector too.\nDeveloped countries should fulfill their promise of credible support to developing countries to build resilience to save lives and livelihoods. This means 50% of all climate finance provided by developed countries and multilateral development banks should be dedicated to adaptation. In his message to every member states, he said, \"don’t wait for others to make the first move. Do your part.\" Countries have the \"opportunity and the obligation to act,\" he said, as he made green policy recommendations. \"Governments must also summon the full force of their fiscal policymaking powers to make the shift to green economies. By taxing carbon and pollution instead of people’s income to more easily make the switch to sustainable green jobs. By ending subsidies to fossil fuels and freeing up resources to invest back into health care, education, renewable energy, sustainable food systems, and social protections for their people. By committing to no new coal plants,\" he said. The Paris targets \"will go up in smoke\" if all planned coal power plants become operational, he warned. Youth protesters in Bangladesh took part in Fridays for Future's global strike, calling on its government to scrap planned new coal and gas projects. Images from the protests show activists holding banners demanding system change and climate justice.  Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the climate crisis and activists are calling for a Green New Deal, like the European Union's, with a move away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy.   Carbon emission output from Bangladesh remains low, but the country is burdened by the climate crisis. The Environmental Justice Foundation estimates that one in seven people in Bangladesh could be displaced by climate change by 2050. Protesters there are demanding that planned new coal and gas power stations are scrapped, with particular pressure for the cancellation of the Matarbari Ultra Super Critical Coal-Fired Power Project, in the Moheshkhali area. The power project is seeking to generate 2400 MW of electricity, but protesters are concerned about its potential impacts on the environment and on the livelihoods of local residents. Climate activists from MAPA (Most Affected People and Areas) countries, which includes Bangladesh, are calling for “colonizers of the north” to pay their climate debt to compensate poorer nations for the damage caused from the climate crisis. Protesters gathered outside the Reichstag, which houses the lower chamber of Germany's parliament, in central Berlin complained that young people were being squeezed out of politics ahead of the weekend election. Others who were old enough to vote said their voices were being drowned out by the country's aging population. Amadeus Truman, a 27-year-old German literature student living in Berlin, has worked with Fridays for Future for more than two years, describing climate action and justice as his passion. \"The parties fighting now for the German parliament on Sunday have let us down. They are so many parties who are telling us they want to cut emissions and it’s on their top agenda, but they don’t have the measures in place, and have not told us how they are going about doing this,\" he told CNN. “I think young people in Germany are highly underrepresented in politics, in the party and voting system – there are so many elderly people that vote and our voices all young people under 40 do not count as much as for those who are, for example, 60 years and older because we have so many elderly people.\" Wolfgang Wolman, a 27-year-old film editor from Berlin, said he didn't hold much hope the country's next government would bring about the climate action needed.  “I blame the older generation for messing things up for us – not personally but in the total of society. They did not take a chance to do anything for us,\" he said.  \"Politicians had the chance to do something about climate change but they have failed us.\"  Katharina Hetzel, a 22-year-old interning with Greenpeace and studying social sciences, said that politicians were \"doing nothing or way too little.\"  \"So that’s why we have to be here. We want a good life – we want to protect our lives and that of our children and future generations to come. And of course, we have to protect Mother Earth,\" she said.  \"Politicians have not seen climate change as a big problem of our times and they thought it wouldn't get worse. They simply did not think about us. They thought about their own lives and wellbeing. I really do feel they have forgotten us. I do think that our entire young generations thinks the same – that’s why we are here.” She said that she wanted to see more young people in politics, including in parliament.  \"If we look at the government there are a lot more older people than younger people and I believe the average age for members of parliament in the Bundestag is over 40 years old, so all the young people, their voices, their thoughts are not being respected or heard.\" Fridays for Future (FFF) is a youth-driven global climate strike movement that started in August 2018, when then 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg skipped school and staged sit-ins on Fridays outside the Swedish Parliament. In the three weeks leading up to the Swedish election, she sat outside the Parliament every school day, demanding urgent action on the climate crisis. Soon, others joined and the group decided to continue their strike until Swedish authorities implemented policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They wanted climate efforts to be in line with goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably 1.5 degrees, above preindustrial levels. Very few countries are in line with that goal right now.  The strikers created the hashtag #FridaysForFuture and encouraged other young people all over the world to join them. They sometimes coordinate their protests, like those today, expected in more than 1,400 locations around the world.  Gazing out from the rocky ledge of Sleeping Beauty's castle in central Germany, the countryside below stretches out in a patchwork of light and dark green forests before stopping dead. At the heart of this lush landscape sits a swath of dry, bare earth. The ground is empty, save for a few ghostly white trunks pointing skywards. Bark beetle infestations worsened by drought conditions and warmer weather brought by climate change has weakened the trees at the Reinhardswald nature park, the scene of childhood favorite fairy takes, like Sleeping Beauty and Little Red Riding Hoo \"Once the bark has peeled off, the trees look a bit like bones,\" said Peter Meyer, head of forest nature conservation at the North-West German Forest Research Institute in Göttingen and Hann Münden. \"Then the beetle can just drill into the tree, lay eggs underneath the bark, and the larvae feed on the tree, interrupting the water supply, and that makes the tree die,\" Meyer explains.  \"Drought is the trigger for bark beetle infestations.\" Germany has suffered historic drought in recent years and 2018 was the warmest since records began 140 years ago. In other parts of the country this summer, rain has fallen hard and fast, triggering deadly floods. All of these events have put the climate crisis squarely on the campaign trail ahead of Germany's federal election on Sunday. It's the first in 16 years that won't feature Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the candidates vying to replace her are all pitching their climate credentials. Read the full story here: Turkish students will join Fridays for Future's global strike in Istanbul at 2 p.m. local time. It is the first strike after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday that his country would bring the Paris Agreement to parliament to be ratified in one month. Turkey is one among just a  handful of more than 190 nations that signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015 but has not yet ratified it with legislation. It's the only G20 nation yet to do so. Police have arrested 17 people in connection with protests at the UK's busiest ferry port of Dover.  Police in the county of Kent said they were dealing with protest activity that began at around 8:20 a.m. local time and had been going for around three hours.  The group has been calling on the UK government to insulate homes across the country to  help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Climate protesters from a group called Insulate Britain have blocked the country's busiest ferry port at Dover after being banned from causing disruption on the M25, a ring road that encircles Greater London.  More than 40 people are blocking the port in an attempt to pressure the UK government into insulating homes across the country to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The UK has a widespread problem with energy inefficiency in its homes, many of which date back hundreds of years and are hard to heat in winter and cool in summer.   Images show protestors blocking the A20 into the port. “Disruption is the only way to keep insulation on the agenda,” Insulation Britain said on Twitter.  “It is the only way to draw attention to ill health & early death as a result of fuel poverty.” The group, which is an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, has caused havoc on the M25 motorway five times over the last two weeks. The group's members are now being threatened with imprisonment if they return to the M25 following a high court injunction banning climate protests there.  The Port of Dover's management said protesters were blocking both the entrance and exit to the port, though it remains open.  Protesters have begun to gather at the Reichstag, which houses the lower chamber of Germany's parliament, in central Berlin. Germany has the highest number of youth protests planned for Friday, with more than 400 scheduled to take place in the country, and the movement's founder, Greta Thunberg, is expected to speak in Berlin.  Youth protesters from over 1,400 locations are calling on the Global North to pay their \"climate debt.\"  “The colonizers of the north have a debt to pay for their disproportionate amount of historic emissions and that starts with the increase of climate finance to implement anti-racist climate reparations,” protest organizers said. “Other socio-economic crises such as racism, sexism, ableism, class inequality, and more amplify the climate crisis and vice versa.” The Global Climate Strike is taking place across all inhabited continents under the banner #UprootTheSystem.  The strike comes as world leaders make key decisions on climate at the UN General Assembly and just weeks before the Cop26 climate summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow. They protest organizers are calling for \"a future where people and planet are prioritized.\" \"They are also asking leaders of the Global North to drastically cut their emissions, ensure equitable distribution of the Covid vaccine and to recognize how the climate crisis impacts human safety, particularly that of indigenous communities.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210924064445-01-global-climate-strike-0924-italy-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20germany&size=30","title":"Europe is paying record prices for energy. A winter crisis looms","date":"Sep 23, 2021","text":"Energy prices are skyrocketing, and as winter approaches, Europe is getting worried. The wholesale cost of natural gas has surged to record highs in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. Bills for households and businesses are already soaring, and could go even higher as cold weather sets in and more fuel is needed for electricity generation and heating systems. \"We've seen huge price increases,\" said Dimitri Vergne, head of the energy team at The European Consumer Organization. \"It's worrying ahead of the winter, when gas consumption will necessarily increase.\" A complex web of factors is at play. A cold spring depleted natural gas inventories. Rebuilding stocks has been tough, thanks to an unexpected jump in demand as the economy bounces back from Covid-19 and a growing appetite for liquified natural gas (LNG) in China. Russia is also supplying less natural gas to the market than before the pandemic. Meanwhile, other sources of power have been less readily available, with calm summer weather quieting North Sea wind farms, and countries ditching coal as pressure builds to tackle the climate crisis. Germany is also phasing out nuclear power by 2022. The deteriorating situation is quickly transforming into a full-blown crisis. Spain has announced emergency measures to cut energy bills, while France plans to make one-time €100 ($117) payments to nearly 6 million lower-income households. In the United Kingdom — where natural gas spikes have already threatened to exacerbate food shortages — Prime Minister Boris Johnson's team is debating the extent to which it should offer state support. A UK price cap for consumers is being maintained, but that's helping to push small British energy companies out of business.  Industries across the region are seeing costs take off. Some British steelmakers have had to suspend operations, according to trade group UK Steel. Norway's Yara, a fertilizer company, is cutting production of ammonia in Europe by around 40% because of the record high natural gas price. \"Right now, it's unprofitable to produce ammonia in Europe,\" said Yara CEO Svein Tore Holsether, noting that it costs $900 to produce a metric ton that sells for just $600. The company will temporarily rely on plants in other parts of the world to supply customers. The fallout could weigh on Europe's economy, while exacerbating fears about inflation at a delicate moment in the pandemic recovery. \"To the extent people are worried about the higher cost of energy, they may be inclined to hold back on spending,\" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics. What's happening The leap in natural gas prices can be traced back to a chilly spring. Cold weather through April and the beginning of May forced a drawdown in natural gas stocks during a period when demand typically eases. \"We started this whole process of putting gas away ... six weeks later than we normally would,\" said Tom Marzec-Manser, a natural gas analyst at market intelligence firm ICIS. But the problems don't end there. China has also been outbidding Europe for LNG, which is preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal as the country tries to make its economy greener. As a result, the price of power for next-day delivery in France jumped 149% between the beginning of August and Sept. 15, according to data from ICIS. In Germany, prices leaped 119%.  And in Britain, which operates a just-in-time market and doesn't have the same storage capacity as continental Europe, costs have surged 298%. Delayed maintenance work, as well as a fire that shut down a power cable that transmits electricity supplies from France, has piled on the pressure. In this environment, European countries would typically turn to Russia, which meets about a third of the continent's natural gas needs. But supplies from Gazprom, the state-backed natural gas company, have been lower than usual. The International Energy Agency on Tuesday called on the country to open the taps.  \"Although Russia is running production at very high levels, there are still fears it can't produce enough to satisfy Europe's very high demand,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Graham Freedman said. \"There are concerns there may not be enough gas in [Gazprom's] storage to get through the winter.\" Marzec-Manser said it's hard to pin down exactly what's happening in Russia. There were some production problems over the summer, and the country is also experiencing higher domestic demand, he said. There are also theories that Moscow is intentionally supplying less than it could to encourage Germany to speed its approvals process for the controversial Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, which will transport natural gas directly from Russia into the European Union. Norway, which supplies about 20% of the natural gas consumed in Europe, is trying to help fill the gap. Equinor, the state energy company, announced this week that it would increase exports starting in October. But in the near-term, experts warn pressure on prices is unlikely to ease. Britain most exposed  Political leaders are trying to assuage fears that the public could go without power or heat as the temperature drops.  \"We do not expect supply emergencies to occur this winter,\" Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK business secretary, told Parliament on Monday. \"There is absolutely no question ... of the lights going out or people being unable to heat their homes.\" But it's increasingly clear that the crisis will be costly, and could weigh on the region's economy while the effects of Covid-19 are still being felt. The situation is particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where seven small energy providers — including Avro Energy, which supplied about 580,000 customers — have failed in recent weeks because their costs have soared. Dozens more are on the brink.  Other British industries are at risk, too. On Tuesday, the UK government said it had agreed to subsidize a major US fertilizer manufacturer at a cost of several million pounds to taxpayers in order to reopen factories that supply most of the carbon dioxide Britain's food supply chain needs.  CF Industries decided last week to halt operations at its UK fertilizer plants because soaring natural gas prices had made them unprofitable. CO2 is used to stun animals for slaughter, as well as in packaging to extend the shelf life of fresh, chilled and baked goods. \"I do not see people freezing,\" said Michael Grubb, a professor of energy and climate change at University College London. \"I do see unenviable choices, between a lot of companies going bust and who picks up the tab.\" The Confederation of British Industry, a UK business lobby group, emphasized Wednesday that \"significant\" price rises hit both businesses and consumers. \"It's essential vulnerable customers and key energy intensive companies, which underpin critical UK supply chains, are well supported throughout the winter,\" Matthew Fell, the chief policy director, said in a statement. A lot rides on the weather. Henning Gloystein, director of the energy, climate and resources practice at Eurasia Group, thinks that if the next few months yield particularly cold weather, there could be further pressure on certain industries to reduce consumption of natural gas to prioritize supplies to households. \"If it gets cold this winter, [supplies] could get really tight,\" he said. \"Politically, that's really toxic.\" Governments will do what they can to shield consumers from rising prices, Gloystein continued, noting that price caps and subsidies are likely to persist. But economists are already revising their inflation expectations for the coming months, cautioning that natural gas shortages will only make price increases triggered by rising demand and ongoing supply chain problems worse.  Prices for CO2 paid by the UK food industry, for example, will go up despite the temporary subsidy to CF Industries. To what extent that gets passed on down the chain to supermarket shelves remains to be seen. \"At the moment, it definitely seems likely we'll be seeing higher inflation in the short term,\" Hinds of Capital Economics said. \"And this is probably going to run into next year.\" She predicted that a previous estimate of headline inflation of 3.5% for Europe in the final months of 2021 could rise to 4%.  \"Gas prices could push inflation further above [the] 2% [target] for longer,\" Bank of America analysts said in a recent note to clients. — Hanna Ziady and Anna Cooban contributed reporting.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210922160640-02-energy-crisis-europe-uk-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20germany&size=30","title":"Phil Murphy prevails in close race in New Jersey, CNN projects","date":"Nov 4, 2021","text":"New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has become the first Democratic governor in more than four decades to win reelection in the Garden State, CNN projects Wednesday, narrowly surviving a closer-than-expected race that dragged well past Election Day. Murphy's victory over Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, albeit slim, defied the state's trend of voting in the party out of the White House in its off-year gubernatorial contests. Virginia -- the only other with odd-year gubernatorial elections -- held to that historical pattern on Tuesday, electing Republican Glenn Youngkin in a resounding blow to Democrats who had made recent gains in the state. But like Virginia, the results in New Jersey -- another state that President Joe Biden carried by double digits in 2020 -- are raising alarms for Democrats who will be fighting to hold onto the suburbs in next year's midterm elections. Biden defeated Donald Trump by nearly 16 points in the Garden State. Polling in the gubernatorial race had suggested the results could be narrower, but as Tuesday night progressed it became clear that Murphy had dramatically underperformed the President, despite having more positive approval ratings in the state than Biden.   Like Democrats did in Virginia, New Jersey Democrats and the Murphy campaign consistently sought to tie the Republican nominee to Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in the state. But those sentiments, some Democrats fretted, might have been undercut by Biden's sinking statewide approval ratings. (He was 6 points underwater in a Monmouth University poll before the election.) Republicans in New Jersey also followed a similar playbook as in Virginia, with Ciattarelli -- a businessman and former state lawmaker -- keeping Trump at arm's length and instead hammering Murphy over taxes and what he argued were the dire effects of the Democrat's pandemic response on businesses.  Murphy's narrow victory may be seen as a verdict on his and other Democratic leaders' commitments to mask and vaccine mandates, which the governor has championed in a state that has suffered about 28,000 Covid-19 deaths.  Before the race was called, a Murphy adviser told CNN that, while it is too early to diagnose in detail the dip in Democratic enthusiasm compared to his 2017 election, robust turnout in areas that opposed some of the governor's stricter measures might have complicated his path. \"You saw astronomical turnout in places like Ocean (County) where people were up in arms on masks and vaccines,\" the adviser said. \"What you see is that people who are upset about vaccines and masks were more likely to vote on that than the people who were happy with his progress.\" The final Monmouth University survey of the race had shown Murphy with leads ranging from 8 to 14 points, depending on different models of who came out to vote. Those figures represented a modest narrowing of the race, in which taxes -- an issue that Ciattarelli led on -- were listed as the top issue. But Murphy's advantage on the question of who voters trust more to handle the pandemic was significantly higher, 45% to 26%, a gap that stayed mostly consistent since the summer. The Democrat also enjoyed a sizable lead on a question that roiled the Virginia race -- education and schools -- leading Ciattarelli by 15 points. But the Monmouth survey also picked up on an enthusiasm gap that may have hurt Murphy, with 38% of self-identified Republicans saying they were more enthusiastic than usual to vote this election compared to 24% of self-identified Democrats. Murphy was saved, in the end, by the overwhelming advantage registered Democrats enjoy over registered Republicans -- more than a million in New Jersey, though voters there have shown a willingness to support moderate GOP candidates, like two-term former Govs. Christie Todd Whitman and, before Murphy's 2017 election, Chris Christie. Murphy aides remained confident throughout the campaign, and on election night, that the governor's popularity would carry him to a second term. His approval ratings had consistently outpaced the President's -- 52% compared to Biden's 43% in the Monmouth poll. \"We're going to get reelected -- or not -- on our own weight here,\" a Murphy adviser told CNN before the polls closed. Still, the governor kept Biden close, welcoming him to the campaign trail and staying in contact as late as the eve of the vote, when the President -- in the middle of a foreign trip -- called and had a conversation with the governor, according to a source familiar with the discussion.  Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany who previously served as the Democratic National Committee's finance chair, also stumped alongside a who's who of national Democratic heavyweights. Biden, former President Barack Obama and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont all headlined events for him to try to drive out base Democratic voters. Obama, speaking in Newark last month, zeroed in on Ciattarelli for having previously addressed a \"Stop the Steal\" rally, then later claiming he was unaware of the event's focus. \"Apparently Phil's opponent says, well, he didn't know it was a rally to overturn the results of the last election. Brother, come on,\" Obama said. \"When you are standing in front of a sign that says 'Stop the Steal,' and there's a guy in the crowd waving a Confederate flag, you know this isn't a neighborhood barbecue.\" Ciattarelli's camp, in response, pointed to his past statements affirming that Biden won the election -- remarks he was attacked over by other Republicans during the gubernatorial primary. Ciattarelli sought to downplay Trump-fueled conspiracy theories over election fraud -- at least as it applied to his own prospects. \"Don't let anybody stay home because they think we can't win or because it's rigged,\" Ciattarelli said at an event last week. \"It's not rigged here in New Jersey. We can win this race.\" Ciattarelli did not name Trump, who did not appear on the trail in New Jersey, but the remark underscored the difficult balance Republican candidates have to strike in states Biden won to get Trump diehards to the polls without alienating suburban swing voters turned off by the former President's behavior and rhetoric. Youngkin's victory in Virginia and Ciattarelli's narrow loss in New Jersey may have helped lay a blueprint for GOP downballot candidates next year. At their second debate, in mid-October, a moderator pressed Ciattarelli over his view of Trump and whether he would accept the former President's support and campaign alongside him. The Republican nominee, who has been critical of Trump but backed him last year, suggested he had no plans to call in the former President. \"I go out there and campaign on my own,\" Ciattarelli responded. \"I'll win my own election.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211103190553-01-phil-murphy-new-jersey-election-1103-restricted-story-body.jpg"}

The new rules will require all foreign nationals arriving in the United States to show proof of being fully vaccinated, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said. He said the new rules would take effect in early November, a timeline that will give agencies and airlines \"time to prepare.\" The lifting of blanket restrictions on travel to the United States from certain countries will come as welcome news to thousands of foreign nationals with families in the United States who have been kept apart for almost the entire pandemic. The Financial Times was first to report the news. In addition to requiring vaccination, the administration said it was taking other steps to mitigate spread of the virus in three other areas: testing, contact tracing and masking. Fully vaccinated foreign nationals and American citizens returning to the United States from abroad will be required to take a pre-departure Covid-19 test within three days of their flight, and show proof of a negative result before boarding. They will also need to do a viral test, such as a PCR or rapid test, three to five days after arrival; the test must be authorized for use in the country where it's administered. Unvaccinated Americans returning to the US will be \"subject to stricter testing requirements,\" Zients said, including a test within one day of departure and an additional test when they return. Fully vaccinated passengers will not be subject to any quarantine mandates upon arrival in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to issue a contact tracing order requiring airlines to collect information from US-bound travelers, including a phone number and email address, to alert travelers of potential exposure. Airlines will be required to keep contact tracing information for 30 days. \"This will enable CDC and state and local public health officials to follow up with inbound travelers and those around them if someone has potentially been exposed to Covid-19 and other pathogens,\" Zients said, adding that this new requirement will be used more broadly going forward to help protect \"against any future public health threats.\" The new guidance applies to all international travel. \"Fully vaccinated,\" as per the CDC, includes those who have received not only the vaccines approved for use in the US but those listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization but have not yet received such approval in the US, such as the AstraZeneca vaccine. The development is a first step toward repairing one of the several emerging rifts between the Biden administration and officials in Europe. A spat has emerged between the United States and France over a deal to equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, depriving France of a contract to provide conventional subs. European leaders also found consultations with the Biden team over Afghanistan to be lacking. It will also be greeted favorably by the travel industry, which had been lobbying the federal government to lift some of the rules preventing international tourism. Airlines, hotels and hospitality groups had all voiced support for allowing vaccinated tourists from abroad back into the United States. Zients maintained that the administration is \"not taking any measures off the table\" when asked about the possibility of vaccine mandates for Americans traveling domestically. And he said there were no updates to existing rules on land border crossings with Canada and Mexico. Welcome news to many US travel bans were first imposed in the earliest days of the pandemic when then-President Donald Trump limited travel from China in January 2020. That step failed to prevent the virus from reaching the United States, but additional countries were added to the list as health officials pressed the White House to limit entry from places where case rates were high. Trump added countries in the Schengen Zone -- which encompasses 26 states in Europe, including France, Germany and Italy -- along with Ireland and the United Kingdom. Brazil, South Africa and India were added separately. Land borders with Canada and Mexico were also closed. Biden had maintained the strict bans on nonessential travel, even as vaccination rates in Europe ticked upward, citing the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the emergence of the Delta variant. But the system proved infuriating to European governments, whose countries' citizens were still barred entry to the United States even as those nations brought their case counts down amid successful vaccination campaigns. Countries with higher cases that were not on the list were not subject to the rules. Months of discussion Over the course of the past months, travel restrictions on people wishing to enter the United States had devolved into a major transatlantic rift. European leaders, frustrated at the apparent lack of progress, began taking their gripes public. They said the rules were damaging relations between Europe and the United States. Europe opened its borders to Americans in June, but last month reversed course, removing the United States from a safe list of countries whose citizens are exempt from quarantine or testing requirements. Anger over a lack of reciprocation from the United States partly fueled the decision, European officials familiar with the matter said. Biden entered office vowing to restore frayed alliances and spent much of a trip to Europe in June proclaiming his commitment to transatlantic ties. He announced during that visit a series of task forces meant to examine reopening travel, but months passed with little to show for the effort. Overseen by the White House Covid-19 response team and the National Security Council, the groups include representatives from the CDC along with officials from the Departments of State, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Transportation. The American officials were partnered with representatives from the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico and have met several times to discuss the reopening situation since the administration announced them at the start of Biden's first foreign trip in June. There have also been multiple smaller group conversations in between those larger meetings to discuss specific issues, like the epidemiological situation, variants, surveillance, and vaccination efforts and plans for changing travel restrictions, a White House official told CNN. But some people familiar with the working groups had questioned their effectiveness, as other countries began to open to Americans with little clarity over whether the US would reciprocate. One source familiar with the discussions described \"paralysis among agencies\" over next steps.  This story has been updated with additional reporting as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210608193214-airport-travel-0528-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20germany&size=30","title":"Long Covid is a bigger problem than we thought","date":"Sep 29, 2021","text":"The long Covid problem might be bigger than we thought. A large study has revealed that one in three Covid-19 survivors have suffered symptoms three to six months after getting infected, with breathing problems, abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, change of bowel habit and diarrhoea, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression among the most common issues reported. Researchers at the University of Oxford, the National Institute for Health Research and the Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre studied symptoms in more than 270,000 people recovering from Covid-19 and found that the nine features of long Covid were detected by clinicians more frequently in those who had been hospitalized, and slightly more often in women.  But Dr. Max Taquet, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical fellow and one of the authors of the study, said the results show long Covid affects a significant proportion of people of all ages. \"We need appropriately configured services to deal with the current and future clinical need,\" he said. The study did not explain what causes long Covid symptoms, how severe they are or how long they will last, but it did show that people recovering from Covid were more likely to suffer long-term symptoms than those who had the flu. Dr. Amitava Banerjee, a professor of clinical data science at University College London who was not involved in the study, said this finding is \"yet another arrow in the quiver against bogus 'this is just like flu' claims.\" The symptoms people experienced varied, and many patients experienced more than one. Older people and men were more likely to have breathing difficulties and cognitive problems, whereas young people and women reported more headaches, abdominal symptoms, anxiety and depression. The authors stressed that although the number of such incidents was higher among the elderly and those with more severe initial illness, people who had suffered a mild disease, children and young adults also experienced long Covid. The accompanying data showed that as many as 46% of children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 22 had experienced at least one symptom in the six months after recovering. This risk of long Covid highlights why is it so important to protect children and young people from the coronavirus, even though the study said most don't suffer from severe illness. Cases among children have been soaring in the US since the more contagious Delta coronavirus variant became the country's dominant strain in July. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported 206,864 weekly cases among children on Monday. That was a slight decline compared to the previous week, but a 188% increase since the week of July 22.  The data comes as Pfizer/BioNTech said Tuesday that they had begun submitting vaccine data on children aged 5 to 11 to the US Food and Drug Administration for review, and expect to submit a request for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks.  The next key question is whether parents will want to get their kids vaccinated. Parents of 5-to-11-year-olds are split on the issue, with 44% saying they are likely to do so and 42% saying they are unlikely to, according to poll results from Axios-Ipsos published Tuesday.   YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.  Q: What is the best time to get flu and Covid shots this year?   A: It is \"perfectly fine\" to get both shots in one visit, White House Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN.   Fauci said people should get the vaccines as soon as they can, whatever it takes. \"If that means getting the flu shot in one arm and the Covid shot in the other, there is nothing wrong with that,\" he added.

READS OF THE WEEK  Turkmenistan claims it hasn't had a single Covid-19 case. Activists say that's a lie  Turkmenistan has not seen a single case of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to its authoritarian government.  The central Asian country is one of at least five states that have not reported any coronavirus cases, according to a review by Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization.   Three of those are isolated islands in the Pacific and the fourth is North Korea, CNN's Ben Westcott reports.  Independent organizations and activists outside Turkmenistan say there is evidence the country is battling a third wave, but President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov is thought to be playing down the threat of Covid in order to maintain his public image.  Diana Serebryannik, director of Rights and Freedoms of Turkmenistan Citizens, an exile group, said the organization's contacts in the country said hospitals were struggling to cope with a rise in cases.  According to Serebryannik, the official cause of death in these cases is not listed as Covid-19 or pneumonia -- instead medical certificates record separate conditions, such as a heart attack.  Here's what to expect when the US opens its borders  The United States is set to ease travel restrictions on all fully vaccinated foreign visitors starting November, but the traveling experience is expected to be vastly different compared to the pre-pandemic times, Blane Bachelor reports.  Travelers will be required to show proof of vaccination and a negative test taken within three days prior to the trip. But they should also be prepared to navigate shifting -- and confusing -- health regulations and protocols that differ from state to state.  Prices are expected to rise for tourists, and there will likely be staffing shortages due to Covid. So, no matter where they're headed, travelers must stay as flexible and informed as possible.  Here's how other governments are tackling low vaccine uptake  Most European countries have Covid-19 vaccination rates that would be the envy of much of the world. But even in these, hesitancy in certain areas is causing governments to take action -- or risk stalling their efforts to control the spread of the virus.  In Germany, vaccines remain voluntary, but authorities have been stepping up measures that make life increasingly inconvenient for those who haven't been inoculated. The German Health Ministry has announced new rules that mean unvaccinated workers will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if coronavirus measures forced them into quarantine.  Meanwhile, France and Italy have introduced mandatory Covid health passes for entry to premises including bars, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, and many other public spaces. The passes show proof of vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or of past infection.  TOP TIP   Encourage your teens to get vaccinated  The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine has been made available for people aged 12 and over, but teens remain the least vaccinated of any eligible age group in the United States. Only 46% of 12-to-17-year-olds in the US are fully vaccinated, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   There is still a misconception that the disease only affects the elderly and vulnerable, but evidence has shown this is false.   Talk to your teens about the benefits of getting the vaccine and explain that while they are far less likely than adults to suffer serious disease or to die from Covid-19, they can still catch it and pass it on. LISTEN TO OUR PODCAST  Covid-19 taught the world a tough lesson: If we aren't prepared for a viral threat, the consequences can be catastrophic. But what does it mean to be truly prepared? The question feels more urgent now that public health officials warn that many of us may experience another pandemic in our lifetimes. Dr. Sanjay Gupta turns to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who anticipated our current crisis, for specific recommendations on how to prevent the next one.

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"European leaders seized more power during the pandemic. Few have 'exit plans' to hand it back","date":"May 17, 2021","text":"Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives across Europe due to Covid-19, and many more have suffered long-term ill health after contracting the disease. They're not the only casualties of the pandemic.  Democratic norms have also been seriously dented by a year of restrictions, and experts now fear power-hungry politicians could be reluctant to give up their near-total authority once the crisis is over.   In France, for instance, parliament approved a bill last week that extends the country's state of emergency until late September. The bill allows President Emmanuel Macron to introduce a health pass, showing whether someone has been vaccinated against Covid-19 or not, as well as curfews across the nation.   The move was seen as controversial by some of Macron's liberal allies: after all, instructing your citizens to be home by a certain time and tracking their medical information is hardly consistent with France's liberal traditions.   Over the course of his presidency, Macron has been accused of drifting from the centrist liberal platform on which he was elected in 2017, most notably taking a harder line on Islam and immigration to compete with his top political rival, the far-right Marine Le Pen.   It wasn't long ago that the French president was extolling the values of democracy. Speaking to the US Congress in 2018, he paid tribute to the \"sanctuary of democracy\" he was addressing and reminded the world of the words \"emblazoned on the flags of the French revolutionaries, 'Vivre libre ou mourir.' Live free or die.\" Ironic, given the president's apparent eagerness to boss his citizens around to stop the spread of a deadly virus.   Macron's loosening relationship with democracy doesn't stop at tracking who's been injected and forcing people indoors. Throughout the pandemic, the president has reduced the role that his parliament plays in scrutinizing his policy announcements.   \"Parliament's role in France is more limited under the new state of health emergency than before,\" said Joelle Grogan, senior lecturer in UK public and EU law at the University of Middlesex. \"There is no obligation for governments and administrations to send copies of orders they adopt to parliament.\"  Democracy Reporting International (DRI) recently published a comprehensive study on how governments across the European Union had responded in the context of democracy and the rule of law. France was listed as a country of \"significant concern\" for the extent to which its government has subverted legal norms.   France is not the only EU nation that has backslid on democracy.  In Austria, Slovenia, Belgium and Lithuania to name a few, there is serious concern that governments have misused existing laws to restrict the liberty of citizens. In fact, DRI listed only Spain out of the 27 EU member states as a country of \"no concern\" when it came to parliamentary or legal oversight of Covid measures.   The most egregious example probably comes from Hungary, where the government passed legislation that allowed it to rule by decree with no judicial review.   Courts in Cyprus and the Czech Republic claimed to have no jurisdiction over coronavirus measures. This significantly reduced moves to safeguard any attempted government overreach.   A central concern of DRI's report is that few European countries have a clear \"exit plan\" for ending states of emergency and returning to normal ways of governance. This is a real concern in the case of France. Phillippe Marlière, professor of French and European politics at University College London, notes that in recent years, France has introduced numerous states of emergency in response to terror attacks. Many of the measures introduced at these times concerning personal liberty have remained in place.   \"I would bet that a lot of the illiberal measures that have come in under Covid, like the health pass and threats of curfews will remain in place or be seen again,\" he said. \"Politicians are very good at taking authority but less good at handing it back.\"  There is particular concern among some that Macron, who is facing election next year, might see keeping a tight grip on power as advantageous.   \"The French president has more power on paper than the American [resident. He can control the police, the army, all domestic policy, all foreign policy. He even appoints his own prime minister,\" said Marlière. \"This, combined with someone seeking re-election who is already shifting to the right on issues like Islam with no real oversight is very concerning.\"   More worryingly, the DRI report also states that only five EU member states -- the Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Portugal -- have adequate exit strategies for a return to normal.   \"It's far easier to govern by decree than to govern within limits, so it's obvious why leaders would want to hang onto powers,\" said Grogan, who also noted that undermining the rule of law has been a problem within the EU for some time.   In recent years, Hungary and Poland had both abused the rule of law to such an extent that article 7 of the EU's treaty, which, if approved by all member states, would restrict both nations' voting rights with the EU and restrict access to EU money, has been triggered against both.   The problem is that both Hungary and Poland are able to veto actions against the other, rendering the EU somewhat toothless. \"What happens next is the big problem. We can talk about legal mechanisms and the laws. But ultimately we need political consensus,\" Grogan adds.  Last summer, Brussels tried to force Hungary and Poland to fall in line though a mechanism in the EU's long-term budget, but ultimately choked at the last minute and agreed a fudge in order to get the bloc's Covid recovery funds approved.   That was two member states. What happens when it's many more is a real unknown for the EU.   \"Fundamentally, the EU is a legal structure. It exists to obligate mutual rights between states and citizens,\" said Grogan. \"But it would be remiss to ignore the complexity beyond that. As Brexit proved it is a group of states deciding to be part of the club. Brexit showed us you can leave, but the problem is if someone doesn't accept the values and doesn't want to leave, it is legally impossible to remove a state.\"   Where this ends is anyone's guess. The EU is unlikely to fall apart, as many have predicted, but it is possible that Euroskeptics across the bloc can force changes that undermine the whole thing. And if you were looking for a way to destabilize the EU, making a mockery of the rule of law would be a good place to start.   \"We're seeing, as usual with emergencies, a shift of power towards the executive with oversight from parliaments, judiciary and other bodies getting weaker,\" said Jakub Jaraczewski, research coordinator at DRI.   \"The EU could work towards better legal oversight -- be it through the Commission, the Fundamental Rights Agency or even through the Court of Justice. But that would require political will from the leadership in member states for the central EU to take control of policy areas they prefer to keep close to their chests.\"  It's sometimes said that EU law is a complicated mess of narrow political interests dressed in a legal cloak. Those narrow political interests have had a greater impact on the bloc's direction of travel than the ideals that supposedly unite 27 vastly different nations.   For the best part of a decade, member states bickering over precisely what Europe should be and how it should respond to crises has been the hardest thing for the EU to navigate. The disregard for law, however, is a more fundamental headache than disagreements on migration or how money should be spent.   When politics returns to something resembling normal, Brussels might find itself with more than just Poland and Hungary on the naughty step. And if these recent delinquents decide that their newfound powers matter more to them than keeping their EU neighbors happy, there is very little that EU grandees can do to stop the fallout destabilizing the whole bloc.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210514122439-01-poland-lockdown-protest-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"Austria to impose Covid lockdown for the unvaccinated age 12 and older","date":"Nov 14, 2021","text":"Austria will implement lockdown measures for all those age 12 and older who are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19 from Monday, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced.   Around 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lower rates in the European Union where cases are surging. Under the measures announced on Sunday, the unvaccinated are ordered to stay home except for a few limited reasons; the rules will be policed by officers carrying out spot checks on those who are out. The lockdown plan which was agreed in September called for unvaccinated Austrians to face a stay-at-home order once 30% of intensive-care beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients. Unvaccinated people are already excluded from entertainment venues, restaurants, hairdressers and other parts of public life in Austria. Schallenberg told reporters on Friday that the government should give the \"green light\" for the move this weekend. \"The aim is clear: we want on Sunday to give the green light for a nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated,\" Schallenberg said at a news conference in Innsbruck. He had earlier called the country's vaccination rate \"shamefully low.\" His warning came as a wave of Covid-19 infections sweeps central Europe. A three-week partial lockdown was announced in the Netherlands on Friday evening, Reuters reported, with health officials recording a rapid rise in cases there. \"Tonight we are bringing a very unpleasant message with very unpleasant and far-reaching measures,\" Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in a televised address, ordering restaurants, supermarkets and non-essential retailers to close early and reimposing social distancing measures. \"The virus is everywhere and needs to be combated everywhere.\" Norway also announced new measures on Friday, while people in the German capital Berlin are preparing for fresh restrictions that come into place on Monday. Schallenberg's tone encapsulated the frustration that several European governments have expressed towards unvaccinated pockets of society, as a wave of Covid-19 infections sweeps the region. In neighboring Germany, ministers have ramped up their rhetoric towards those who are not inoculated. Its capital Berlin announced on Wednesday it will ban people who are not vaccinated from indoor dining, bars, gyms, hairdressers and cinemas from next week. Vaccine rates vary across Europe but get steadily lower towards the east of the continent.  Russia has hit a new daily record for Covid-19 deaths, with 1,241 registered in the previous 24 hours, the country's coronavirus task force said on Saturday. With the latest figures, the country has reached a total of 254,167 deaths since the start of the pandemic. German officials meanwhile warned on Thursday the country remains in the grips of a ''very worrying'' rise in Covid-19 cases and advised residents to \"urgently to cancel or avoid larger events if possible, but also to reduce all other unnecessary contacts.\" According to the latest figures from the Robert Koch Institute, the country's seven-day incidence rate has risen to 263.7 cases per 100,000 people -- up from 169.9 cases reported a week ago.   The Norwegian government said on Friday it would reintroduce \"a few more national measures\" to \"reduce the [Covid-19] infection\" in the country. Health Minister Ingvild Kjerkol said \"unvaccinated people over the age of 18, who live with someone who is infected with the virus, will have a duty to get tested,\" adding the obligation would apply from November 17. The government will also advise municipalities to start testing unvaccinated healthcare workers twice a week, with a clear message that they must wear a mask, according to the statement. For the second consecutive week, Europe was the only region in the world where cases and deaths were found to be climbing in the World Health Organization's weekly global report. Between November 1 and 7, there was a 1% increase in new weekly cases, the update said, and just over 3.1 million new cases were reported. The region also reported a 10% increase in new deaths over the last week.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211114072846-austria-lockdown-unvaccinated-intl-story-body.jpg"}

That projection accounts for the scale up of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the US over the next 90 days and continued spread of the B.1.1.7 virus variant throughout the nation. An April 1 forecast projected 609,000 deaths by July 1 and warned that continued relaxation of public health measures and increases in mobility could lead to large surges of cases, like those seen in Michigan. In the worst-case scenario, in which fully vaccinated people return to pre-pandemic levels of mobility, the model predicts 697,573 deaths by August 1. If 95% of the US population wore masks, the projection drops to 604,413 deaths by August 1. ##Hotspots## Bolivia's border with Brazil will remain closed for one additional week until April 17, so that further Covid-19 infections can be avoided, authorities announced on Friday. \"After reviewing the different evaluations regarding the epidemiological evolution at the border, it was decided to close another seven more days through a multi-ministerial resolution,\" Bolivia's Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Integration, Benjamín Blanco, told the state Bolivian Information Agency (ABI). As of Thursday, Bolivia's health ministry reported a total of 279,207 coronavirus cases and 12,412 deaths. ##Hotspots## ##Restrictions## It’s “highly likely” the US Food and Drug Administration will allow Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to be used in children aged 12 to15, according to the acting chairman of an FDA vaccine advisory committee. “It’s highly likely, if the data submitted support it,” said Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan. Monto is also serving as acting chairman of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee in their review of Covid-19 vaccines.  “I think it could be done relatively quickly,” he added. Pfizer applied to the FDA earlier today to expand its emergency use authorization (EUA) or its vaccine to be used in children aged 12 to 15. Currently it is authorized for ages 16 and up. Monto said the FDA likely won’t ask the committee he chairs to meet to discuss expanding the use of Pfizer’s vaccine down to 12-year-olds. “They’re not going to have advisories every time they tweak things,” he said. He couldn’t speculate on how long it would take the FDA to consider Pfizer’s request to amend its EUA. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized for use in people over the age of 18. ##Vaccines## The Brazilian state of Sao Paulo will be easing some of its coronavirus restrictions starting Monday, the regional government announced Friday.  The level of restrictions will be assessed again on April 18, authorities said.  The head of the Covid-19 task force in Sao Paulo state, Joao Gabbardo, said the current restrictions have brought the desired results – the reduction of cases and hospitalizations – but a wider opening of activities is out of the question at the moment. Under the new guidelines, sports events would be able to take place without spectators and restaurants will be open for takeout. The ban on in-person religious ceremonies and a curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. local time will remain in place. During the worst of the crisis for Sao Paulo state, intensive care unit occupancy reached 90.5%, according to state health authorities, but on Thursday authorities said it had gone down to 88.6%.  Also on Friday, the city of Rio de Janeiro announced that it is easing some of its measures too, allowing bars and restaurants to be open until 9 p.m. local. The beaches will remain closed.  The level of restrictions in Rio city will be assessed again on April 19, authorities said.  Yesterday, the Brazilian Senate said it will open an inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, as President Jair Bolsonaro continues to avoid lockdown measures despite the country's mounting death toll. On Thursday, Brazil recorded over 4,200 new Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours, raising its total toll to more than 345,000 – second only to the United States. ##Restrictions## ##Hotspots## Canada says its third wave of the pandemic is now more serious than the previous two, as hospitalizations and critical care admissions spike, and the vaccine rollout is unlikely to change things over the next few weeks.  “The end is definitely in sight but we’re not there yet. This third wave is more serious and we need to hang in there for another few weeks to make sure that we can flatten that curve, drop those numbers down again, to give a chance for vaccines to take hold,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Friday.  The situation is most serious in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, where officials say the province is close to its \"worst case scenario\" projections for the third wave. The province came dangerously close on Friday to shattering a record for a single day increase in cases and has already set a record this week for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions related to Covid-19.  “We’re seeing more and more young people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19. So to young people: There are more contagious and more serious variants out there, even if you’re younger, you can get sick very, very quickly,” Trudeau warned.  Ontario imposed a province-wide stay-at-home order Thursday but restrictions have only moderately decreased new infections, despite the fact that cities like Toronto have been in some form of lockdown since late November.  “I can understand the frustration, the anxiety, the concern that Canadians right across the country are feeling in seeing these numbers rise, I share it. I think we’re all recognizing that we don’t want to be in this third wave but we’re here,” Trudeau said.  Across the country, Canadian health officials say ICU admissions are up more than 20% in the last week alone as all of Canada’s most populous provinces cope with a third wave more threatening to the healthcare system than the last two.  “Right now my concern is, the thing to me is the ICUs filling up, not just hospitalizations, because there is an absolute limit to ICU capacity not necessarily because of equipment but because of people,” Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s top doctor, said speaking alongside Trudeau during Friday’s news conference. Although Canada broke a record this week for vaccine doses administered, Tam said the vaccine rollout will not slow the rapid epidemic growth in cases, as more contagious variants spread throughout the country.  ##Hotspots## ##Variants## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are aware of several incidents involving adverse reactions to the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine in four states. In a statement released on Friday, CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told CNN: “CDC is aware of several incidents of vaccine recipients experiencing dizziness, light headedness, feeling faint, rapid breathing, and sweating (vasovagal or anxiety-related) symptoms following COVID-19 vaccines in Iowa, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina.” Officials in several of those states had previously confirmed to CNN that vaccinations were temporarily paused due to adverse reactions to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  At this time, CDC and FDA “are not recommending health departments stop administering any lots of COVID-19 vaccine,“ the statement says. “CDC has performed vaccine lot analyses and has not found any reason for concern.” Severe side effects from the vaccine are uncommon, and many people won’t experience any side effects at all.  But the CDC said “some people will have pain or swelling at the injection site or fever, chills, or a headache. These typically don’t last long and are signs that your body is building protection.” ##Vaccines## Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccinations at the Cumming Fairgrounds in Georgia are being paused out of an abundance of caution, the Georgia Department of Health and the North Health District announced in a news release on Friday. On Wednesday, eight people had adverse reactions after being vaccinated, according to a statement from Nancy Nydam, spokesperson for the state's Department of Health. One person was taken to the hospital for evaluation and the other seven people were monitored on-site and sent home, the release said. “The reactions were consistent with common reactions in adults being vaccinated with any vaccine, but due to the number of individuals affected, the site stopped the J&J vaccinations to evaluate,” the statement said. In total, there were 425 Johnson & Johnson vaccines administered at that location on Wednesday, and “tens of thousands of J&J doses have been given statewide with no adverse reactions.”  “There is no reason to believe there is anything wrong with the vaccine itself, and other individuals who have received the J&J vaccine should not be concerned,” said Dr. Kathleen Toomey, Georgia's health commissioner. “We are looking into what happened and what may have caused the reactions, including the conditions at the fairgrounds such as heat and the ability to keep the site cool.” Georgia is at least the third state to evaluate incidents with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. North Carolina and Colorado also paused vaccinations earlier this week due to adverse reactions. Nydam said Iowa is also “evaluating incidents,” related to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. CNN is reaching out to the Iowa Department of Health about the vaccine. Remember: It's relatively common to experience side effects from any of the three vaccines available in the US – about 10% to 15% of volunteers in vaccine trials developed \"quite noticeable side effects,\" Moncef Slaoui, former Operation Warp Speed Chief scientific adviser, said late last year.  Severe side effects, like allergic reactions, are far less common.  CNN Health has reached out to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about these incidents. ##Vaccines## Pfizer requested an amendment to its emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine, to expand its use in people ages 12 to 15 in the United States. Currently, the vaccine is authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration in people aged 16 and up.  “The companies plan to request similar rulings by other regulatory authorities worldwide in coming days. These requests are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which demonstrated 100 percent efficacy and robust antibody response after vaccination with the COVID-19 Vaccine,” Pfizer said in a statement Friday. The other two Covid-19 vaccines – made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – are currently authorized for emergency use in people age 18 and older. ##Vaccines## Despite vaccination efforts, Michigan remains “unquestionably a national hot spot right now\" for Covid-19, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. Michigan has not seen this high of a positivity rate since the first surge last spring despite conducting many more tests now, an official with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said. “This indicates that there is now broad community spread,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services chief medical executive and chief deputy director for health, said. The positivity rate increased to 18%, which is four times what health officials saw last February, according to Khaldun Hospitalizations are also increasing. At least 15.2% of hospital beds across the state are being used to care for Covid-19 patients, Khaldun said. Hospitals are evaluating and implementing their surge plans, including considerations of canceling elective surgeries, Khaldun stated. The number of cases and patients doubled in the last two weeks at Spectrum Health and continue to climb each day, according to Spectrum Health CEO Tina Decker. The more contagious B.1.1.7 variant is believed to have contributed to the surge, Decker explained. Gov. Whitmer proposed various efforts to double down on increasing case numbers. The governor urged high schools specifically to voluntarily go remote for two weeks following spring break. Youth sports have also been encouraged to suspend practices and games during this two-week period, Whitmer added. Over 56 pop-up testing sites have opened on school campuses across the state and are now offering post-spring break testing, Khaldun said. She urged those who have recently traveled or have plans to travel to get tested. Whitmer and Khaldun both advised people to avoid indoor dining. Instead, they should choose to get takeout to support local businesses. “To be very clear, these are not orders, mandates, or requirements. A year in, we all know what works, and this has to be a team effort. We have to do this together. Lives depend on it,” Whitmer stated during the press conference. Even those who have already received the vaccine should mask up, wash hands, and socially distance, the governor emphasized. “This is my ask to you, the people of Michigan. Please, redouble your efforts on these fronts for the next couple weeks, Whitmer said. “It’s everybody against Covid, and we have to keep going until we win.” Over 5.1 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, meanwhile, have been administered to over 3.1 million people in Michigan, Whitmer said.  This marks a new milestone for the state. Nearly 40% of residents have been vaccinated in less than four months, and the rate continues to speed up, Whitmer said. Michigan administered 1 million doses, to surpass the 5 million mark, in less than two weeks, according to the governor. CNN's Miguel Marquez contributed reporting to this post.  ##Vaccines## ##Hotspots## Doctors have published new details on a handful of people who, after receiving AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, developed what they describe as a rare immune response that caused blood clots and low platelets. In two reports published Friday, an analysis of 16 patients in Germany, Austria and Norway describe a number of clots in “unusual sites” like the brain and abdomen. These events occurred roughly a week or two after receiving the vaccine, and some of these cases resulted in death.  Both reports in the New England Journal of Medicine suggest naming the diagnosis “vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia,” or VITT. The diagnosis refers to the underlying cause: platelet-activating antibodies that cause a cascade of clotting and falling platelets. These reports come two days after the European Medicines Agency said \"unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects” of AstraZeneca’s vaccine. However, the agency affirmed the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of Covid-19. That statement also said an abnormal immune response could be “one plausible explanation,” adding that it wasn’t possible to identify specific risk factors at this time. Doctors say this resembles an autoimmune phenomenon known to be triggered by the blood-thinner heparin, which none of these patients had previously received. In that disorder — known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or HIT — platelets are similarly activated by antibodies that attach to heparin, when bound to another protein found in platelets.  On Friday, the European Medicines Agency announced it was also reviewing possible links between blood clots and another Covid-19 vaccine, Johnson & Johnson’s. The company said in a statement that while \"no clear causal relationship has been established,” it is working with experts and regulators to take a closer look at the data. AstraZeneca made similar comments Wednesday, stressing that its vaccine “offers a high-level of protection against all severities of Covid-19 and that these benefits continue to far outweigh the risks.\" ##Vaccines## ##AstraZeneca## Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 coordinator, on Friday defended the Biden administration’s decision not to surge coronavirus vaccines as part of its increased effort to send more federal resources to states with increases in Covid-19 cases.  Earlier during Friday’s briefing, Zients said the federal government would deliver more testing and surge federal personnel to states with cases trending in the wrong direction.  But when pressed on why the administration would not send more Covid vaccine doses to those hurting states, Zients underscored that the virus was unpredictable. “There are tens of millions of people across the country in every state and county who have not yet been vaccinated. And the fair and equitable way to distribute the vaccine is based on the adult population by state, tribe and territory. That’s how it’s been done, and we will continue to do so,” Zients said. He continued, “The virus is unpredictable. We don’t know where the next increase in cases could occur and you know that we push out all vaccines as soon as its available. And we’re not even halfway through our vaccination program. So now is not the time to change course on vaccine allocation. We’re going to stick with the allocation system of allocating by state adult population.” Then Zients reiterated the other plans the administration has to surge resources, saying, “That said, it is a challenging situation in many states. And we want to do all we can to help those states.”  ##Vaccines## Jeff Zients, President Biden's Covid-19 Response Coordinator, said Johnson & Johnson will have “relatively low level of weekly dose delivery until a company secures FDA authorization” of its independent manufacturing facility. Zients said that Johnson & Johnson is working closely with the US Food and Drug Administration to resolve manufacturing issues at this independent contractor, Emergent BioSolutions. The Baltimore plant makes the drug substance that goes into the vaccine. It does not yet have FDA authorization to send out its material and has had some problems making the vaccine. “Johnson & Johnson is installing a new senior leadership team to oversee all aspects of production and manufacturing for the facility and Johnson & Johnson will have full responsibility for the operation,” Zients said at a Covid-19 White House briefing on Friday. Once Emergent gets FDA authorization, Zients said that the company expects a cadence of up to eight million weekly doses in total across state and federal channels later in April. Next week, the number of Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine shots allocated to states and other jurisdictions by the federal government is expected to drop 84%, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Johnson & Johnson said it will meet its commitment to provide “at or near” 100 million doses by the end of May. ##Vaccines## Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a White House briefing Friday that Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are increasing – particularly for younger people – while deaths are going down. Yesterday, the CDC reported over 74,000 news cases, Walensky said. “CDC’s most recent data show that the seven-day average of new cases is a little more than 64,000 per day, up about 2% from the prior seven-day period,” Walensky said. “Hospital admissions continue to also increase. The most recent seven-day average, about 5,300 admissions per day, is up about 7% from the previous seven day period.” “Deaths have continued to decrease, more than 20% with a seven-day average now of 711,” she said. Increases in cases and emergency room visits are being seen in younger adults, many of whom have not been vaccinated, Walensky said. Those aged 18 to 25, 26 to 54, and 55 to 64 have increasing numbers of emergency department visits, she said, while people aged 65 and older have decreasing visits, “likely demonstrating the important impact of vaccination in protecting against disease requiring hospitalization.” Walensky said that while those are national statistics, the trends are magnified in some areas of the country.   ##Hotspots## Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 coordinator, said the federal government will intensify the surging of resources to states experiencing increased Covid-19 cases.   Zients said the surge in resources will include coordinating the administering of existing vaccine doses, offering to send in federal personnel, provide additional testing capacity and offering more therapeutics and treatments.  “When we see metrics trending in the wrong direction, we talk regularly with state officials to offer assistance, including deploying CDC teams to provide their expertise and resources,” Zients said during a White House Covid-19 briefing on Friday.  “With recent increases in cases in some states, we’re intensifying those efforts even further. We will be offering to states with significant increases in cases a set of additional tools to help them to stem the spread, including, first: working with states to ensure they are using all of the doses that they have received. Today, millions of doses have been distributed, but have not yet been administered as shots in arms.” He continued:  “Second, we’re offering to surge federal personnel, including CDC response teams, FEMA, DoD and other federal personnel to support vaccinations and get more shots in arms. Third, providing additional testing capacity, including increasing the availability of diagnostic testing, as well as screening in schools and other settings. And fourth, offering more therapeutics and treatments. All of this is on top of the more than three-fold in vaccines that have gone to all states and jurisdictions since the President came into office. For a medium sized state, this translates into hundreds of thousands of additional vaccines each and every week.”    Greece has joined a number of European Union countries in putting restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.  Greece’s National Vaccination Committee has recommended the vaccine only be offered to those aged 30 and over.  The decision follows a warning by Europe’s drug regulator on Wednesday of a slim risk that AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine could cause rare blood clots.  In a statement, the committee pointed out that despite the restrictions: “The risk of serious illness and death from Covid-19 is overwhelmingly higher than the risk of thrombosis after vaccination especially in those over 30 years of age.”  After evaluating the available data, the Committee said that “it recommends the continuation of the vaccination program with any available vaccine, including the AstraZeneca vaccine, to individuals aged 30 years and older.”  Ahead of the announcement, Health Ministry Secretary General for Primary Health Care, Marios Themistokleous said he does expect “major changes in our vaccination schedule.” Speaking on Greece’s public broadcaster ERT Thursday, Themistokleous added there are 10,00 to 12,000 vaccinations with AstraZeneca on a daily basis in Greece and that that public participation during the last week has been over 90%.  Meanwhile, local media are reporting an increase in people not turning up for their AstraZeneca jab appointments. Greece is experiencing a recent surge in cases while strict measures remain in place.  ##Vaccines## ##AstraZeneca## In an official statement, Johnson & Johnson said that the company is “aware” that there have been thromboembolic events (blood clots) “reported with all Covid-19 vaccines.” “Our close tracking of side effects has revealed a small number of very rare events following vaccination. At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine,” the statement released on Friday said.  J&J said that it is working closely with experts and regulators to take a closer look at the data. The company said people who get the Covid-19 vaccine and experience any severe symptoms should seek medical assistance immediately.  Symptoms could include shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in the leg, persistent belly pain, neurological symptoms, excessive or easy bruising, or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of injection. Earlier this morning, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it is reviewing possible links between Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine and blood clots.  EMA said there were reports of four serious cases of people who had developed blood clots after they got the vaccine. It is unclear if the clots are connected to the vaccine or related to some other medical issue.  You can find more information on the J&J vaccine here. ##Vaccines## The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is reviewing possible links between Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine and blood clots.  EMA said there were reports of four serious cases of people who had developed blood clots after they got the vaccine. It is unclear if the clots are connected to the vaccine or related to some other medical issue. One case involved a person in a clinical trial, and the three others happened during the US roll out of the vaccine. In one of the cases, the person died, the release said. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine was authorized for use in the European Union on March 11, but the vaccines have not yet been rolled out there. The EU rollout is supposed to start in the next few weeks. Only the US is currently seeing a supply of J&J vaccines.   The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is reviewing the blood clot cases and will announce what it has found once the investigation is complete. ##Vaccines## The World Health Organization continues to believe that the benefits of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risk of rare side effects, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news briefing in Geneva on Friday.  “Even as we work to expand access to vaccines, we’re continuing to keep a close eye on vaccine safety,” Tedros said.  All vaccines and medicines carry a risk of side effects, he said, adding that: “In this case, the risks of severe disease and death from Covid-19 are many times higher than the very small risks related to the vaccine.”  Earlier this week European and British medicines regulators announced a “possible link” between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare cases of blood clots, with the UK announcing it would offer people under 30 an alternative vaccine. Later on Wednesday, WHO released a statement saying that “a causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots with low platelets is considered plausible but is not confirmed.” Tedros reiterated this point Friday.  “The Covid-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on vaccine safety has reviewed available information from Europe and other regions and has said that a causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots with low platelets is plausible, but more investigation is required,” he said.  “WHO, EMA and MHRA continue to recommend that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk of this very rare side effect.”   ##Vaccines## ##AstraZeneca## National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told STAT News that developing a pill to treat Covid-19 as soon as someone is diagnosed is his “dream.” “It’s just a damn long pathway,” Collins said. Collins said “this is an extremely high priority,” for himself and his colleague Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden.  It’s also important for “the Biden administration, to work with these companies to try to make sure that we speed this up,” he said. “This pandemic is going to be with us — even with great vaccines — and people are going to get sick.” Collins told STAT that a pill like this could have further applications beyond Covid-19. “What we might end up doing here is curing the common cold,” Collins said. “Then I wouldn’t have to listen to those jokes anymore.” Vaccine advisers to the federal government tell CNN they don’t foresee AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine being used in the United States, and even if it were offered, they personally wouldn’t take it, given that other options are available. European drug regulators said Wednesday there was a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots. Some countries – more than 70 have authorized the shot – have now limited its use. One adviser told CNN that federal health officials have privately expressed concern that offering AstraZeneca could increase vaccine hesitancy in the US, which is already a problem among some groups. “I think they’re crossing their fingers that AstraZeneca won’t apply for emergency use authorization,” the adviser said. “This vaccine has a checkered past. There’s baggage. Why go down that road if we don’t have to?” Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines have excellent safety records, with tens of millions of shots without any reported serious side effects. “Everyone would raise questions. ‘You’re not giving me that new blood clotting vaccine, are you?’ ” another adviser said, referring to AstraZeneca’s vaccine. “Why muddy the waters with a vaccine that comes with a somewhat checkered reputation?” In an email, an AstraZeneca spokesperson declined to respond specifically to the advisers’ concerns, but pointed CNN to AstraZeneca’s Phase 3 results in its US trial, which showed that the vaccine was 76% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe or critical disease and hospitalization. According to a company statement, the blood clots are an “extremely rare potential side effect.” Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN that even if the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to AstraZeneca’s vaccine, there’s no need for it right now in the United States. “It’s not any indictment against the product. We just have a lot of vaccines,” he said. ##Vaccines## ##AstraZeneca## A Japanese woman whose lungs were severely damaged by Covid-19 has received what doctors say is the world's first lung transplant from living donors to a recovered coronavirus patient. Kyoto University Hospital said the woman underwent an 11-hour operation by a 30-strong medical team on Wednesday to transplant lung tissue from her husband and son. Covid-19 is known to cause severe lung damage in some patients, and people around the world -- including the United States -- have received lung transplants as part of their recovery from the disease. But the Kyoto hospital said this case was the first in which lung tissue had been transplanted from living donors to a Covid-19 patient. Dr. Hiroshi Date, a thoracic surgeon at the hospital who led the operation, said it gave hope to patients suffering from severe lung damage from Covid-19. \"We demonstrated that we now have an option of lung transplants (from living donors),\" he said at a Thursday news conference. The patient, identified only as a woman from Japan's western region of Kansai, contracted Covid-19 late last year, and spent months on a life support machine that worked as an artificial lung, according to Kyoto University Hospital. Covid-19 caused so much damage to her lungs they were no longer functional, and she required a lung transplant to live. Read more: More than half of rural residents in the United States have received a Covid-19 vaccine or plan to, but one in five still say they will definitely not get vaccinated, according to analysis released by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Friday. KFF researchers surveyed 1,001 adults living in rural America and found that 54% said they have received a Covid-19 vaccine or plan to.  One in five rural residents said they definitely won’t get vaccinated. About 73% of these respondents lean Republican and 41% identify as White Evangelical Christians. “There’s nothing inherently unique about living in a rural area that makes people balk at getting vaccinated,” KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said in a statement. “It’s just that rural areas have a larger share of people in the most vaccine-resistant groups: Republicans and White Evangelical Christians.”  The report suggests that access to vaccines is not the major problem for rural communities. About 11% of the rural residents surveyed who have yet to receive a vaccine said they have tried to get an appointment, compared to 21% of those in urban areas and 22% in suburban areas. About 68% of rural residents said there are enough vaccine sites in their area, compared to 52% of urban and 55% of suburban residents. The KFF team did note a gap in access among Black rural residents. Black respondents were less likely than their White or Hispanic counterparts to report adequate supply of vaccine or vaccine sites in their communities. While the KFF researchers say there was no message that was effective across the board at swaying those who say they will definitely not get vaccinated, those who plan to “wait and see” whether they want to get the shot appear to be more open to messaging and education.  About 64% said that hearing the vaccines are 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death would make them more likely to get vaccinated. Over half said that hearing that scientists have been working on this vaccine technology for 20 years would make them more likely to get vaccinated.  The researchers expressed concern that the large number of rural residents who say they are set on not getting vaccinated could mean that eventually rural communities will lag behind the rest of the population in vaccination coverage. ##Vaccines## Two Venezuelan mayors are in hot water after marking the houses of potential Covid-19 patients with warning signs -- a measure that has been harshly criticized by civil rights NGOs and has prompted an investigation by Venezuela's attorney general. In a video posted on his official Instagram account on Tuesday, Mayor Luis Adrian Duque of Guama, a small village in the central Venezuelan state of Yaracuy, announced the measure as part of the town lockdown policy. \"We are protecting our people, [this sign] indicates a positive case or a potential case, so that people are aware,\" Duque says in the video, pointing to a red prohibition sign placed on the window of a local house. People caught removing the Covid-19 signs on their homes would be fined 10 million bolivars, a sum out of reach for many in Venezuela, where the minimum monthly salary is less than a US dollar. Those who were not able to pay the fine would be required to serve days of \"voluntary\" community services, Duque said. A photo posted by mayor's office in the neighboring city of San Felipe also showed local officers standing next to a similar \"quarantine\" sign. The photo, which touted Mayor Rogger Daza's campaign against the coronavirus, has since been removed from social media. Some users on social media commended Mayor Duque for taking a strong stance against the pandemic, which has piled stress on a health sector already damaged by seven years of economic crisis.

Earlier this week, Bolsonaro shrugged off criticisms that he is \"genocidal\" in his opposition to Covid-19 restrictions, as the nation recorded its deadliest 24 hours of the pandemic. Bolsonaro has downplayed the threat of the virus while claiming that the economic impact of shutdowns would hurt Brazilians more than Covid-19.   Brazilian Supreme Court judge Luis Roberto Barroso ordered the Senate to set up a commission for the investigation on Thursday, after requests from 32 of Brazil's 81 senators. Announcing the ruling, Barroso said that Brazil is \"at its worst, breaking regrettable records of daily deaths and cases of infection.\" On Thursday, Brazil recorded over 4,200 new Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours, raising its total toll to more than 345,000 -- second only to the United States. The president of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, said he would comply with the order but that the investigation could sabotage efforts to fight the pandemic and become a \"political theater aiming at the 2022” general elections. The probe will look at the actions of former health ministers Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Nelson Teich, army general Eduardo Pazuello, and the current minister of health Marcelo Queiroga.   Barroso has called for the inquiry to focus on \"the actions and omissions\" of the federal government, particularly in the state of Amazonas. Several Covid-19 patients reportedly died in Manaus, the state's capital, when hospitals ran out of oxygen earlier this year. The Supreme Court also ruled Thursday that states and municipalities have the power to prohibit in-person religious gatherings, a move that Bolsonaro had fiercely opposed. ##Hotspots## Indonesian President Joko Widodo warned against vaccine nationalism and called for support on “vaccine multilateralism” on Thursday in a summit held online between the leaders of the Developing Eight Group (D-8), according to state-run Antara news agency. “D-8 must continue to promote equitable access to vaccines,\" Widodo said. “Vaccine affordability and availability is key to exit the pandemic.” The Developing Eight Group (D-8) includes Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Addressing the group via video conference Thursday, Widodo warned: “We are witnessing an increase in vaccine nationalism and we must reject this.” He called on the D-8 leaders to be open to future cooperation in vaccine development and production. “We must support vaccine multilateralism,” he said, according to the Antara report. Read more about vaccine nationalism: ##Vaccines## India on Friday crossed 13 million total cases of coronavirus, making it only the third country in the world to do so. The country reported 131,968 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, the highest single-day rise since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a CNN tally of figures from the Indian Ministry of Health.  India has recorded 1 million cases in just 11 days. India last added 1 million cases in the same time frame in September 2020, when the country was experiencing the peak of its first wave. India recorded 780 new deaths on Friday, the highest single-day death toll since October 18 last year, according to a CNN tally of figures from the Indian Ministry of Health. According to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is better equipped to handle the caseload during the second wave compared to the first wave. The country needs to focus on micro containment, ramping up testing, quick contact tracing of positive patients and providing treatment, he said Thursday. “Despite all the challenges, we have better experience, resources and a vaccine. Along with public participation, our hardworking doctors and healthcare staff have helped a lot in handling the situation and are still doing it today,” Modi said at a meeting with chief ministers of states taking stock of the ongoing second wave on Thursday.  Vaccine shortfall: States such as Maharashtra, Odisha and Punjab have complained of vaccine shortages and several districts in Maharashtra have had to suspend vaccination drives, the state’s health minister said Thursday.  According to a senior administrative official in Mumbai, more than 70 centers in the city have said they do not have vaccines available. The central government has said it is doing everything it can to help the states, the health minister said in a statement earlier this week.  ##Hotspots## Japan recorded 3,405 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, exceeding the 3,000 cases mark for the second day in a row, the Health Ministry announced Friday. The new cases bring the nationwide tally to 494,440, less than four months ahead of the Olympic Games. The national death toll hit 9,331 Thursday. The number of patients suffering from coronavirus and in a serious condition stands at 483 as of Thursday, across the country. That’s up from 19 reported on Wednesday.            Japan's rise in cases come as the Tokyo prepares to host the Olympic Games, set to start July 23. On Monday, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the rise in cases has not yet reached the level of a nationwide fourth wave, but extra vigilance is required. ##Hotspots## Australia has secured an extra 20 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine after declaring it preferable to the AstraZeneca vaccine for recipients under 50. Speaking Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a total of 40 million Pfizer doses would arrive in Australia before the end of the year. \"I want to thank Pfizer who have been a very good partner with Australia,” Morrison said. “Particularly given the advice that we received from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation yesterday.\" On Thursday Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said the AstraZeneca vaccine should only be given to people under the age of 50 if the “benefit clearly outweighs the risk for that individual's circumstances.\" Australia had previously ordered 20 million doses of the Pfizer drug but was relying heavily on 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally. The decision to limit AstraZeneca dosages forced a “recalibration” of the entire vaccine rollout plan, Morrison said.  AstraZeneca vaccines continued to be administered to over 50s in Australia on Friday. Authorities in the state of New South Wales briefly stopped administering AstraZeneca vaccines until it could be determined that all those registered to receive them were eligible under the new guidance. ##Vaccines## The number of Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine shots allocated to states and other jurisdictions by the federal government is expected to drop 84% next week, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This week, nearly 5 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were allocated to states and other jurisdictions, but only about 785,000 are slated for next week. Allocations of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for next week, however, will remain steady compared to this week. About 4.7 million first doses of Pfizer and 3.5 million first doses of Moderna have been allocated for next week, along with corresponding second doses. Allocations of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been largely consistent week to week. However, weekly allocations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have varied widely.  According to data from the CDC, the first allocation of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – for the week of March 1 – included more than 2.8 million doses. There are no allocations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine logged for the week of March 8, and allocations dropped to less than 500,000 doses for the two following weeks. Then, for the week of March 29, allocations jumped to nearly 2 million, before more than doubling for this week. Here are the total allocations for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to states and other jurisdictions each week, according to data from the CDC:  Week of March 1: 2,833,400\nWeek of March 8: none\nWeek of March 15: 493,700\nWeek of March 22: 389,900\nWeek of March 29: 1,911,200\nWeek of April 5: 4,947,500\nWeek of April 12: 785,500 About 4.5 million people have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, accounting for about 7% of people who are fully vaccinated in the US, according to the latest data from the CDC. ##Vaccines##","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200213175736-02-coronavirus-0213-story-body.jpg"}

In his first prime-time TV address last night, Biden escalated the nation's \"war footing\"  to help beat the virus. He announced that he was directing all states, tribes and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated by May 1, stating his administration would build out the infrastructure of clinics, vaccine doses and medical staff to make that prospect real.   But the President  also asked the American people to do their part. \"I will not relent until we beat this virus. But I need you, the American people ... I need every American to do their part,\" Biden said. \"I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity. And to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated as well.\"  Biden sounded optimistic about the progress of the vaccination rollout. He moved his target for getting 100 million shots in peoples' arms from his first 100 days in the White House to his 60th day in office, saying the US will maintain and beat its current pace of 2 million shots per day.   According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 33.9 million Americans are now fully vaccinated.  If everyone does their bit, Biden said, \"By July the Fourth, there's a good chance you, your family and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.\"  But this message of unity couldn't be further away from the battles over safety measures emerging all over the country.  In Texas, State Attorney General Ken Paxton is now suing leaders in Austin for maintaining local mask requirements, saying they illegally defy the governor's order ending a statewide mandate.  Paxton's lawsuit sets the stage for the latest showdown in a long-running, nationwide clash over public health rules that often breaks along political lines. Sixteen states have no statewide mask rule and there are growing divisions between local and state leaders on what public health measures should stay in place.   Experts are clear on the issue: daily case numbers in the US remain high and -- as Biden's chief medical adviser on Covid-19  Dr. Anthony Fauci put it to CBS last night -- are \"absolutely not\" low enough to relax public health measures.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.  Q: If I already had Covid-19, should I still get vaccinated?  A: Yes, according to the CDC. \"Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection,\" the agency says.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  More nations pause AstraZeneca vaccine use as blood clot reports investigated  Denmark, Iceland and Norway have suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine while the European Union's medicines regulator investigates whether the shot could be linked to a number of reports of blood clots. Danish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke made clear the pause was a \"precautionary measure,\" saying it was not possible yet to draw conclusions.  Several other European countries have suspended use of specific batches of the vaccine, including Italy, Austria, Lithuania, Estonia, Luxembourg and Latvia.  The reports that people in Denmark and Austria had experienced blood clot side-effects after receiving the shot prompted Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to cancel plans to publicly get the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday.  Other countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain and the Netherlands, have said that they see no reason to stop using the AstraZeneca shot.  For Britain's elderly, first touch with a relative 'means everything'  In a small nursing home by the southern English seaside, David Alexander, 89, walks into his wife's bedroom for the first time since October. Before even putting down his bags, David sits on Sheila's bed, next to her armchair, and holds her hand -- for only the second time since the pandemic came to Britain.  Throughout the pandemic, Sheila was cut off from everyone who loved her because the country's  nursing and care homes have largely remained closed to visitors. Now the UK's vaccine rollout has made an incremental but significant change possible. Phil Black and Mick Krever report on some of the first reunifications of loved ones.  More than 1 in 5 health care workers experience depression and anxiety during the pandemic, study says  Staggering numbers of health care workers -- 21.5% -- have experienced anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder during the pandemic, global research has revealed.  Healthcare workers have been working long hours under strenuous conditions. Because of this, Nathaniel Scherer, co-lead author of the study, said he was unsurprised by the numbers. \"Previous evidence has shown that these experiences can lead to stress, fatigue and burnout, which can increase the risk of common mental disorders,\" said Scherer, a research assistant at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"August 5, 2021 US coronavirus news","date":"Aug 5, 2021","text":"California has become the first state to require all employees in healthcare settings to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread, the state announced Thursday. California’s Department of Public Health issued two new health orders Thursday that mandate workers in healthcare settings be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and requires hospitals and nursing homes to verify that visitors are fully vaccinated or have tested negative for the virus.  Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last month the state would require healthcare workers in the state to either be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing, but Thursday’s order went a step further, requiring California’s approximately two million healthcare workers until the end of September to become fully vaccinated and promises paid time off to get immunized. “By requiring health care workers to be fully vaccinated and visitors to acute care facilities to demonstrate they are fully vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19, California is protecting the most vulnerable individuals, while also protecting workers in these settings,” the state's public health department said in a news release. The decision comes as the state sees a surge in new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and the positivity rate, with all three metrics reaching their highest levels since February. “As we continue to see an increase in cases and hospitalizations due to the Delta variant of COVID-19, it’s important that we protect the vulnerable patients in these settings,” said California Health Officer Dr. Tomás J. Aragón. “Today’s action will also ensure that health care workers themselves are protected. Vaccines are how we end this pandemic.” California’s public health department is expected to update guidance for visitors to other long-term care facilities in the near future. Quebec — Canada's second-most populous province — plans to implement vaccine passports, Premier Francois Legault said during a Thursday news conference.  \"So, unfortunately, like we said a couple of months ago, we’ll put in place the passport in order that people who made the effort to be vaccinated, that they are able to come back to a normal life. So it means that, some services will, nonessential services will be available only to vaccinated people,” Legault said in a news conference covered by CNN Canadian news partner, CBC News.   On Thursday, the province recorded 305 new coronavirus cases; 72 of those cases are still under investigation. There are 16 people in intensive care units in the province.  \"In the last few days, we saw an increase in the number of cases. After discussion with public health, it looks like, unfortunately, in the next few days, few weeks, will see, still, an increase in cases and also an increase in hospitalization,\" Legault said. The US should expect tens and thousands of vaccinated people to get Covid-19, but most won’t get very sick, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday. “I think we all have to recognize that with 164 million people who are vaccinated, we should expect tens of thousands, perhaps, of breakthrough infections,” Walensky told CNN. The important thing is not the number of people who experience breakthrough infections, but the level of illness those people experience, Walensky said. “Those breakthrough infections have mild illness. They are staying out of the hospital. They are not dying, and I think that that's the most important thing to understand,” Walensky said. Walensky noted that vaccinated people who get infected with Covid-19 can transmit the virus. Fully vaccinated people who get a breakthrough infection can pass it on, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday.   “Our vaccines are working exceptionally well,” Walensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in reference to fully vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections. “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death – they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.” CDC provided data last week that showed how fully vaccinated people who get a breakthrough infection can carry essentially that same amount of virus as an unvaccinated person, allowing them to transmit the virus just like an unvaccinated person can. That is why the CDC is recommending even vaccinated people wear masks indoors again, Walensky said. “If you're going home to somebody who has not been vaccinated, to somebody who can't get vaccinated, somebody who might be immunosuppressed or a little bit frail, somebody who has comorbidities that put them at high risk, I would suggest you wear a mask in public indoor settings.” Clarification: This post has been updated to specify that Walensky was referencing fully vaccinated people who get a breakthrough infection when saying that vaccines no longer prevent transmission of Covid-19. ##Vaccines## Internal discussions at the US Food and Drug Administration have centered around an early September timeline for laying out a strategy on Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, a Biden administration official told CNN. The strategy would apply for all vaccinated people. A decision for those who are immunocompromised and face greater risk from the virus is expected sooner. FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco said in a statement to CNN that the FDA, along with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, are evaluating potential solutions to questions on the use of booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines. \"The agencies are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary. This process takes into account laboratory data, clinical trial data, and cohort data – which can include data from specific pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely on those data exclusively,\" Capobianco said. \"We continue to review any new data as it becomes available and will keep the public informed. We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.\" Capobianco said \"in the near future\" the FDA will share information on potential options for immunocompromised people who face a greater risk from the virus than healthy people. \"The FDA is closely monitoring data as it becomes available from studies administering an additional dose of the authorized Covid-19 vaccines to immunocompromised individuals,\" Capobianco said. ##Vaccines## The Texas Medical Center campus in Houston just passed more than 300 coronavirus patients admitted in their medical facilities in a single day, according to Mayor Sylvester Turner.  Turner and Harris County Court Judge Lina Hidalgo spoke at a joint news conference on Thursday outlining the situation for the Houston-Harris County metro area.   \"Today we find ourselves retracing our steps towards the edge of a cliff. It is very conceivable that we could once again be heading toward a public health catastrophe. Once again our health care system is strained by Covid-19. It’s straining our staff, straining our hospitals, and it is imposing heartbreak and anxiety on so many families in Harris County,\" said Hidalgo. The emergency rooms have become overwhelmed with large amounts of patients being admitted to the hospital, said Hidalgo, adding that this is no longer a disease of the old. The average age of admitted patients is now 20. Harris County's Covid-19 threat rate has moved into the red zone, declared by Hidalgo in today's news conference, meaning outbreaks are present and getting worse.  The biotechnology company Novavax has pushed back its plans to apply for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine in the US to the fourth quarter of this year, according to the company's second-quarter financial results, released on Thursday.  Previously, the American biotech firm had planned to apply in the third quarter. \"It looks like it could be the fourth quarter,\" Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development for Novavax, told CNN on Thursday.  \"We're still moving along nicely,\" Glenn said. ##Vaccines## The daily pace of Covid-19 vaccinations is the highest it’s been in nearly seven weeks, according to the latest data published from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here’s the latest data on vaccination efforts in the US, according to the CDC:  Fully vaccinated: 49.9% of the total US population (all ages)\nNot vaccinated: 31.9% of the eligible US population (ages 12 and older)\nCurrent pace of vaccinations (seven-day average): 464,778 people are initiating vaccination each day.\nThis is the highest average daily pace in nearly seven weeks since June 19. \nThis is a 19% increase over last week’s pace.\nAn average of 699,261 doses are being administered each day.\n20 states have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, DC.\nAlabama and Mississippi are the only states to have fully vaccinated less than 35% of residents.  White House data director Dr. Cyrus Shahpar tweeted earlier Thursday that more than 864,000 doses had been reported administered over the previous day’s total, including about 585,000 people who got their first shot. According to the White House, that is the highest number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered – and new vaccinations – reported in a single day in more than a month. ##Vaccines## Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava announced today that the county is taking a further step to ensure a safe and healthy workplace by requiring weekly Covid-19 testing of all Miami-Dade employees.  Those who wish to opt-out can provide proof of their vaccination status, Cava said. The county will begin implementing this policy beginning the week of Aug. 16 for non-union employees and exceptions will be evaluated on a case by case basis, according to the mayor. Cava said over the last week, the county polled its workforce with a voluntary anonymous survey to ask employees to self-report their vaccination status. Of those who took the survey, which is more than 5,000 employees, more than 83% of the respondents indicated that they had taken the shot, according to the mayor. “We all know that getting vaccinated is the single best step that any of us can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones to reduce the spread of the virus. Truly it is the path forward and this policy that we are announcing today will help ensure we are doing our part to maintain a safe, healthy workplace and that county employees are doing our part to prevent the spread of Covid across this community,” Cava said. ##Vaccines## The Alaska village of Stebbins is in community lockdown after a surge in Covid-19 cases, according to the regional health organization. Norton Sound Health Corp. announced the lockdown in a news release Monday, saying the lockdown would stay in place until no new cases are identified for 14 days. They said Thursday that there were three more positive Covid-19 cases in Stebbins, bringing the total of active cases to 45. The lockdown began seven days ago, Norton Sound Health Corp. said. Citing the Stebbins Community Association, Norton Sound Health Corp. said that during the lockdown, visiting between households or other communities is not allowed and everyone should wear a mask in public indoor spaces.  “There is a 10-person limit at the store, and a five-person limit at the laundromat,” the release said. “There will be no bingo during this time, and there is a curfew of 10 p.m.”  According to Norton Sound Health Corp, there are 51 active Covid-19 cases in the region, with the 45 in Stebbins, three in Nome and three in regional villages that “have requested that their village not be identified.” As of the end of July, 42% of the 676 residents of Stebbins were fully vaccinated, and 45% have received a first dose. “Stebbins experienced a Covid-19 outbreak last fall, which took nearly two months to recover from. The residents there know what it takes to overcome an outbreak, and now everyone 12 years and older has the added benefit of accessibility to Covid-19 vaccines,” Norton Sound Health Corp. said in the release.   Minneapolis Public Schools will be requiring masks starting Aug. 9, according to an update posted on the school system's website Thursday morning. The school district's update said that all staff, students and visitors are required to wear face coverings indoors, regardless of vaccination status. They said the decision was made based on the recommendation from the state's health department.  The district also said that face coverings will be mandated on school buses, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Additional details will be provided for families as students return to school in September, the district said.  ##Masks## Amazon on Thursday pushed back its office return date until early next year amid a surge in Covid-19 cases from the Delta variant, making it one of the most significant delays yet in the tech industry. The online retail giant's corporate workers were originally slated to start coming back to the office by Sept. 7, but that date has now been moved back to Jan. 3, 2022, Amazon told CNN Business. When they do return, employees will be required to wear masks inside the office unless they have shown proof that they are vaccinated, the company added. Amazon's news follows similar announcements delaying a return to in-person work from financial firms like Wells Fargo, BlackRock and US Bank. US Education Sec. Miguel Cardona said it was \"frustrating\" to hear a letter from a Florida superintendent to Gov. Ron DeSantis asking him to allow a temporary mask mandate amid rising Covid-19 cases.  \"This is preventable. This isn't Delta variant. This is policies that are preventing students from getting to the classroom safely. And just to see that, you know, my heart goes out to the superintendents that are trying to do the right thing and are being pushed in the wrong direction,\" Cardona said to CNN's Ana Cabrera.  DeSantis issued an executive order last week that threatened to pull funding from schools that implement mask mandates. \"That would be so disappointing if our students — who have been waiting to get back into their classrooms, who’ve done everything we've asked them to do — it’d be disappointing if their school year is disrupted because of decisions by adults,\" Cardona said.  When asked if schools should be opening with vaccine requirements, Cardona said he's \"confident\" that schools can reopen safely. \"Last year, we safely reopened schools without the tests that are available now, without the resources for reopening and ventilation that we have now, and without the vaccines. So I am confident we can do it. We have to just make sure we're following those mitigation strategies and promoting vaccination amongst the youth,\" he said.   Cardona said he is talking with governors, state leaders and superintendents to ensure proper safety steps are taken and to set up vaccination clinics.  \"If we leave the politics out of it, let our educators and leaders lead, I'm confident we're going to get the students back in,\" he said.   The Louisiana Department of Public Health reported Thursday there are currently 2,350 people in the state hospitalized with Covid-19, an all-time high. The previous record was 2,112 on Tuesday.  Of those 2,350 Covid patients, 258 are on ventilators and 89% are unvaccinated.  The health department said 98% of the state’s 5,468 new case are tied to community spread.  “This update represents increases across all age groups and regions of the state,” the department said in a tweet.  There have been 567,787 cases of Covid-19 in the state since March 2020. The Louisiana health department reported 33 new Covid-19 related deaths bringing the death toll to 11,162.  Limited hospital staffing and beds continue to stress Mississippi’s health care system, state health officials said at a press conference this morning. There are only eight remaining intensive care unit beds available in four hospitals across the state, according to state epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers, who said hospitals report bed availability to the health department twice per day. At one point this week, more than 275 adults with Covid-19 were hospitalized in the ICU, Byers said, with 150 people on ventilators. Byers said the data overwhelmingly shows higher case, hospitalization and death rates among unvaccinated individuals. Mississippi, along with neighboring states Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana, make up the states with some of the lowest vaccination rates nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Wednesday morning, only 35% of Mississippians were fully vaccinated, compared to the 50% national average, according to the Mississippi health department. “It's important to know that we are seeing rapid spread of the virus in all parts of the state, and we do not anticipate that that spread or transmission is going to decline at this point,” Senior Deputy and Director of Health Protection Jim Craig said. “Anticipate that we're going to continue to see rises in cases and rises in transmission.” In Michigan, at least 83 Covid-19 cases have been linked to July's Faster Horses Festival, a three-day country music and camping festival at the Michigan International Speedway.  \"If you attended the Faster Horses Festival, you may have been exposed to the virus,\" according to a July 24 news release from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS).  In the July release, MDHHS initially reported 17 cases tied to the festival. As of Thursday, less than two weeks later, there are more than 80 cases connected to the festival, MDHHS spokesperson Chelsea Wuth confirmed to CNN.  Nine of the cases are \"secondary\" cases, or people who did not attend the festival, said Wuth.  MDHHS is urging everyone who attended the event to get tested \"if they are not fully vaccinated or if they develop symptoms,\" said MDHHS's Dr. Joneigh Khaldun in the July release.  To date, 58.5% of eligible Michiganders have at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose and 54.1% are fully inoculated, according to MDHHS's vaccine tracker.  The Faster Horses Festival took place on July 1 to18 and was headlined by county singers Jason Aldean, Thomas Rhett and Luke Combs, according to the festival's website.  CNN has reached to festival organizers for comment but has not heard back.  Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients on Thursday praised momentum for vaccine mandates, days after President Biden issued a vaccine requirement for all federal workers and contractors.  “Already, we're seeing momentum in vaccination requirements across the country, businesses know vaccinations are a way to keep their workers and customers safe and to keep their doors open,” Zients said kicking off a rare second White House Covid-19 response team briefing of the week, highlighting a new feature from Yelp that lets customers search for businesses with fully vaccinated workers or proof of vaccination to enter the business. He applauded businesses big and small, including Saffron, a small business in New Orleans requiring proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test, 650 colleges and universities requiring on-campus employee and student vaccination, a mandate from historically Black medical schools, and a mandate for health care workers at Kaiser Permanente. “Our message is quite simple: We support these vaccination requirements to protect workers, communities and the country,” Zients said. Zients also touted progress in vaccinations in recent days, noting that over the past 24 hours, the US recorded 864,000 vaccinations, the highest daily rate since July 3. “Clearly, Americans are seeing the impact of being unvaccinated and unprotected. And they're responded by doing their part, rolling up their sleeves and getting vaccinated,” Zients said. In the states with the highest case rates – Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi – people are getting vaccinated at “a pace not seen since April,” he said, adding that Tennessee has seen a 90% increase in first shots over the past two weeks, Oklahoma has seen an 82% increase, and Georgia has seen a 66% increase in first shots over the past two weeks. Zients also told reporters that the Biden administration’s Covid-19 surge response teams are now working with 16 states on specific needs, with “hundreds” of federal personnel deployed to help throughout the country. Dr. Jayne Morgan, executive director of Piedmont Healthcare Covid Task Force, told CNN's John King on \"Inside Politics\" that she is seeing progress in vaccinations but said the number needs to be close to 2 to 3 million. \"We do see our vaccination rates increasing. We also see our rates of infection increasing as well. And our hospitalizations have probably increased seven- or eight-fold in the last five or six weeks.  The Austin Independent School District will require students to wear masks on school buses, the district announced Thursday. It says the requirement follows the federal order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, requiring face coverings on public transportation. \"Because of Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order, Austin ISD can’t mandate masks in our schools, but the federal order requiring them will apply on our school buses,\" a statement from the district said, adding, \"Mask usage was effective last school year to keep infection rates low in schools.\" Abbott has been firmly against schools mandating masks. \"In Texas, there will not be any government-imposed shutdown or masks mandates,\" he said Wednesday. It is unclear whether Abbott would try to prevent Austin schools from requiring masks on school buses. Students will have assigned seats on buses to help the district with contact tracing, according to the statement. Buses will operate at full capacity and will be cleaned every day. \"We know masks kept our students and teachers safe last year, and the CDC agrees that masks can keep our children safe,” said Kris Hafezizadeh, executive director of transportation. “That's why masks — along with assigned seating and, weather permitting, open windows — are required on our buses. We are asking parents to send their children wearing masks. If we all wear masks, we'll all be OK.\" ##Schools## Current federal data on the rate of hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people does not include data on Delta variant, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday. Walensky spoke in response to a question from CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on whether data indicating 99% of Covid-19 deaths and 95% of Covid-19 hospitalizations are occurring in unvaccinated people still holds up in the context of the Delta variant. Key members of the federal Covid-19 response team, including Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, have repeated these numbers in recent weeks. “Those data were data that were from analyses in several states from January through June and didn't reflect the data that we have now from the Delta variant,” Walensky said in a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing. “We are actively working to update those in the context of the Delta variant.” “I do want to reiterate though that based on the data we're seeing, we don't have fully updated numbers, universally, as we look at our hospitalizations, and as we look at our deaths, they are overwhelmingly unvaccinated people,” she said.  The second largest school district in Arizona currently has more than 100 active cases of Covid-19 within the school district, and a total of more than 140 cases since school started two weeks ago, with 39 cases now listed as \"resolved.\" Chandler Unified School District has 103 current cases of Covid-19, according to the district's online Covid dashboard. The schools with the highest case count are Hamilton High, with 32 cases, and Chandler High, with 10 cases. \"We will continue to monitor confirmed cases and make adjustments to our mitigation plan as necessary,\" Chandler Unified School District spokesperson Terry Locke told CNN Thursday. The district could not provide a total number of students and teachers being quarantined in the district as a result of the positive cases. CNN previously reported that the district updated its quarantine policy just days before school began, after an edict from Gov. Doug Ducey's office last month, which told two other school districts they had to withdraw their policy of requiring unvaccinated students to quarantine if they were exposed to Covid, saying it was against state law. Quarantining is now optional for all Chandler students with known exposure to Covid-19, regardless of their vaccination status, unless they are exhibiting symptoms. \"We are asking our families to discuss the importance of effective hand-washing and sanitizing to stay home when they are ill,\" said Locke. The school year started in Chandler on July 21. ##Schools## France’s Constitutional Council upheld key elements of a new pandemic law on Thursday that will require the use of health passes to access many public spaces and services. Starting Monday, health passes that show proof of Covid-19 vaccination, a recent negative test, or confirmed recovery from a previous infection will be required to enter most public places including cafés, restaurants, and long-distance trains. These provisions of the health law “do not establish any obligation of healthcare or obligation of vaccination,\" said the Constitutional Council in its decision. The court also validated the legality of requiring vaccinations for health workers. However, the decision scrapped certain other measures proposed by the law, including mandatory isolation for anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 and the ability to fire restaurant and café workers who do not have health passes. Protests against the extension of health passes have been recurring every weekend throughout the country since July 12, when the government announced the policy plan. The court decision came as France is battling what officials are calling the “fourth wave” of the pandemic. According to data from the health authority, the number of patients in French hospitals and intensive care units continues to grow steadily, with 1,371 patients in ICU on Wednesday, compared to only 992 patients the week before. The number of hospitalized patients also jumped from 7,208 to 8,134 in the last week. More than 43 million people in France have received at least one vaccine dose and more than 36 million people – about 50% of the population – have been fully vaccinated as of Wednesday. ##Travel## Germany, France, Israel, and the UK are all forging ahead with plans to begin administering Covid-19 booster shots starting in, or before, September, despite calls from the World Health Organization on Wednesday to ensure poorer countries have enough shots to vaccinate their populations first.  WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for wealthy countries to impose a moratorium on boosters until \"at least the end of September, to enable at least 10% of the population of every country to be vaccinated.\"  \"We need to focus on those people who are most vulnerable, most at risk of severe disease and death, to get their first and second doses,\" Katherine O'Brien, director, immunization vaccines and biologicals at the WHO said, echoing Tedros’ call. However on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that France would forge ahead with its booster program starting from September.  “We are preparing ourselves like other European countries, to carry out a third dose for people who are the oldest and most fragile. And we will do it from the beginning of September,\" Macron said in a video message on Instagram.  Some background: Israel, Germany and the UK have all announced booster programs for their most vulnerable populations to slow down the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant, all of which are due to commence either before, or by the start of September.  The WHO has spoken out against booster programs throughout 2021. Calling on wealthy nations and pharmaceutical companies to instead prioritize vaccinating more of the world’s population, to prevent the emergence of more contagious Covid-19 variants.  Africa currently has the slowest vaccine rollout, with less than 2% of people fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, coronavirus deaths across the continent have surged by 80% in the last month, according to the WHO.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the Biden administration would also be willing to offer boosters shots if needed, once the Food and Drug Administration updated its guidance on the issue, calling the WHO’s call a “false choice.” Wealthy nations continue to sign deals with pharmaceutical companies to secure additional doses. In July, the US signed a deal with Pfizer to buy 200 million more vaccines, to help with both pediatric immunization and booster shots. ##Vaccines## ##Boosters## The state of Florida leads the nation in the number of adults and children admitted into the hospital with confirmed cases of Covid-19, data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention shows.   The latest CDC data, published Thursday, shows that at least 2,065 adults and 47 children were admitted with Covid-19 into Florida hospitals since the previous day. Texas trailed behind Florida with at least 1,318 adults and 40 pediatric Covid-19 hospitalization admissions.  Florida also leads the nation in the total number of children hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 cases. CDC data shows at least 143 children are hospitalized in Florida, with 140 children hospitalized in Texas.  As for total adult Covid-19 hospitalizations, Florida leads the nation with 12,373 patients, followed by Texas with 7,727, according to the latest CDC data. In recent weeks, Florida has led the nation in the number of new Covid-19 cases reported, accounting for about 1 in 5 new cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  The UK government will update its \"green\" travel list on Thursday to add Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to the list. Travelers returning from green-listed countries do not need to quarantine unless their required PCR test result is positive. The travel list changes announced will come into effect on Aug. 8 in England. Arrivals to England from France will also no longer need to quarantine beginning Aug. 8 if they are fully vaccinated, according to a Department for Transport statement released Wednesday. The British government will also move India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE from the \"red\" list to the \"amber\" list, meaning that travelers arriving from those countries will no longer need to quarantine if they test negative for Covid-19 and are fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by the UK. The UK considers travelers to be fully vaccinated two weeks after having received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine authorized by the UK government, the European Medicines Agency or the US Food and Drug Administration. Approved vaccines include the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, or the Janssen vaccine (only one dose of Janssen is required). Meanwhile, Georgia and Mexico will be added to the \"red\" list on Thursday, requiring travelers arriving from those countries to quarantine for 10 full days in a government-run hotel at a cost of about $3,200 per single adult. The overseas French departments of La Reunion and Mayotte will also be put on the \"red\" list due to the prevalence of the Beta variant, according to the Department for Transport. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid added: \"As well as moving more countries to the 'green' list, today's announcement also demonstrates the need for continued caution. Further countries have been added to the 'red' list to help protect the success of our vaccine roll out from the threat of new variants.\" ##Travel## Germany will go ahead with coronavirus vaccine boosters from September, despite calls from the World Health Organization to delay booster shots until more people are vaccinated around the world. However it will also donate at least 30 million vaccine doses to poorer countries.  ''We want to provide the vulnerable groups in Germany with a precautionary third vaccination and at the same time support vaccination for as many people in the world as possible,\" Germany's health ministry told CNN in a written statement.  German health minister Jens Spahn has approved a plan to begin administering Covid-19 booster shots to elderly and at-risk people from September.    ''The option of booster vaccination in September is intended to ensure that those who are particularly at risk are adequately protected: immunocompromised patients, the very elderly and nursing home residents,'' the health ministry said.  ''By the end of the year, Germany had given out at least 30 million vaccine doses to countries in which vaccination has hardly been possible so far,” the statement continued, adding that 80% percent will be made available to COVAX and 20% will be given away bilaterally. ''The first vaccination doses will be donated to the COVAX initiative this week.” ##Vaccines## ##Boosters## China's capital Beijing has started imposing compulsory quarantine on people coming from medium- or high-risk Covid-19 areas. “People who have entered Beijing from high-risk areas are subject to a 14-day centralized quarantine and a 7-day health observation; people who have entered Beijing from medium-risk areas are subject to a 14-day home quarantine and a 7-day health observation,” senior government official Wang Daguang said at a news conference on Thursday. Wang added that the city also require people to present a negative test when they are entering Beijing from cities with active Covid-19 cases, and they are required to have a 14-day health observation reporting to their communities, working unions, or hotels. According to National Health Commission's latest report, China now has 4 high-risk areas and 154 medium-risk areas, with different forms of epidemic control such as quarantine and travel restrictions implemented. If good control over community spread of the coronavirus isn’t achieved, and more people don’t get vaccinated, then it’s possible that there may be another variant that is worse than Delta, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America, Thursday.  “That will happen, George, if we don’t get good control over the community spread,” Fauci said when asked if the US is facing a continuous cycle of seeing new variants.  “And as long as the virus continues to spread, you give it ample opportunity to mutate, and when you give it ample opportunity to mutate, you may sooner or later get another variant, and it is possible that that variant might be in some respects worse than the already very difficult variant we’re dealing with now,” he said. “Which is a major reason why you want to completely suppress the circulation of the virus in the community.”  This is why he and his colleagues keep saying how important it is to get as many people as possible vaccinated.  “People who say, I don’t want to get vaccinated because it’s me and I’ll worry about me, I’m not having any impact on anybody else, that’s just not the case,” he said. “Because when people don’t get vaccinated, it allows the virus to circulate through the community, and when it does, even if it doesn’t make a particular individual ill, they may be asymptomatic, that person is still a vehicle for the spread to other people.”   ##Vaccines## Coronavirus-related deaths in Africa reached a record peak in the week ending Aug. 1, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Over 64,00 deaths were recorded across Africa, a 2% rise compared with the previous week, the WHO said in a news release Thursday. South Africa and Tunisia accounted for over 55% of the fatalities, but death trends are now on the rise in 15 African nations, the WHO found.   With over 172,000 deaths recorded, Africa now accounts for roughly 4% of all Covid-19 fatalities globally.  “It’s a sad day for Africa. Our hearts go out to everyone who has lost friends and loved ones. Deaths have peaked week-on-week on the continent and after a slight dip, COVID-19 cases are surging again. The latest data tells us that Africa is still on the crest of the third wave,” Dr Phionah Atuhebwe, New Vaccines Introduction Officer at WHO Africa said in a statement. At least 22 African countries have seen coronavirus cases rise for the last two weeks, according to the WHO, and continent-wide infections rose by 19% in the week ending Aug. 1, with 278,000 new cases recorded.  Africa currently has the slowest vaccine rollout in the world, with less than 2% of people across the continent fully vaccinated.  Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine shows 93% efficacy through six months, and the company expects to complete its application for full US Food and Drug Administration approval this month, it said in a news release Thursday.  “In final analysis of Phase 3 COVE study data, the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine showed 93% efficacy, with the efficacy remaining durable through six months after administration of the second dose,” the news release said. “Moderna has initiated the rolling submission process for a Biologics License Application (BLA) for our vaccine in the U.S. and expects to complete its submission in August.” Moderna initiated its rolling submission for a BLA on June 1. The data reflecting 93% efficacy reflected participants who had been fully vaccinated by Nov. 2020 and evaluated again four to six months later, prior to the current surge of Delta related cases in the US. “I am proud of the progress our teams at Moderna have made in the past quarter in advancing our development pipeline while addressing a global pandemic and quickly establishing global manufacturing and commercial organizations,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the news release. “We now have mRNA candidates in clinical trials across five therapeutic areas including infectious diseases, cardiovascular, oncology, rare disease and autoimmune disorders. We are pleased that our COVID-19 vaccine is showing durable efficacy of 93% through six months, but recognize that the Delta variant is a significant new threat so we must remain vigilant.” ##Vaccines##","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200213175742-05-coronavirus-0213-story-body.jpg"}

Which is when you're suffering, when you need a helping hand, when you need a little assistance, to just get over a moment of crisis you didn't create. That's when leaders are supposed to kick in to say, \"I'm here I see you and I will help you.'\" Standing in front of boxed produce, Harris broke down the benefits of the bill from the direct payments, child tax credits to COBRA subsidies. She spoke about the administration’s efforts to make sure the bill provided equity, describing at one point the difference between charity and duty.     She also talked with employees today about how many union members are getting vaccines and vaccine hesitancy in communities of color. “Whatever vaccine you are offered, you need to take,” Harris told employees at a fulfillment center, after reiterating that she, Biden and Nevada’s governor all got different vaccines. ##Vaccines## Portugal has announced that it is suspending use of the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford as a “precaution.” Portugal is the latest European country to halt AstraZeneca vaccinations following reports of patients developing blood clots post inoculation. France, Germany, Italy and Spain have also suspended use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. “Portuguese health authorities today decided to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19 for reasons of precaution and public health,” Portugal’s national health authority said Monday in a statement.  According to the national health authority, the decision was taken “due to reports of the appearance of blood clots in vaccinated people.” The decision comes despite assertions from the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunizations (JCVI) that the vaccine has been “rigorously tested for safety.”   The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also said Monday that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks, adding that the number of people developing blood clots after vaccination does not seem to be higher than in the general population. The agency said it would hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to advise on “any further actions that may need to be taken.”   ##Vaccines## ##AstraZeneca## Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that his city does not \"have enough doses yet\" to meet President Biden's goal of making all adults over the age of 18 eligible for a coronavirus vaccine by May 1. \"I would like to see more doses,\" Garcetti told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"We've used 98% of what was sent.\" Garcetti made it clear that his city has the capacity to handle vaccinations and are making progress within minority communities.  \"We have the largest mass vaccination site in the world at Dodger Stadium,\" Garcetti said. \"And we're doing vaccine equity. Dr. Fauci praised us last week for mobile teams that are going to Black and brown communities, in-home vaccinations that we're doing as well as our use of technology and free rides to text people when appointments open up and offering free rides.\" \"I've been very pleased to see this administration each week adding more and more doses and I'm hopeful in a week or two we'll finally get the flood of vaccines that we've been promised, because we're ready to double overnight the number of shots we're putting in arms here in L.A.\" Watch: ##Vaccines## Brazil has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine and 38 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello announced Monday.  Pazuello said he plans to have the entire population of Brazil vaccinated by the end of the year. The contract signed with Pfizer estimates the delivery of one million doses in April, another 2.5 million in May, 10 million in June, 10 million in July, 30 million in August, and 45.5 million in September. The Johnson & Johnson contract says that 16.9 million doses will be delivered in August and another 21.1 million in November. Meanwhile another 13 million doses of Moderna vaccine are currently under negotiation. Last Friday, the ministry announced a deal for 10 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. The country also has another 20 million doses of the vaccine from Bharat Biotech. The Brazilian government is expecting to have 562 million doses by the end of December, including Covax, AstraZeneca and Coronavac. But Brazilian health regular agency Anvisa has so far only approved the use of AstraZeneca, CoronaVac and Pfizer's vaccines. ##Vaccines## Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced Monday that they’ve crossed the milestone of one million people vaccinated for Covid-19 in the state. During an afternoon news conference, Beshear said 1,002,356 Kentuckians have had the vaccine and 70% of those vaccines have gone to residents who are 50 and older. The governor said the state has seen nine weeks of declining cases. “We are getting very close to a total case number that’s close to 10% of our population,” Beshear said.  The governor also said more than 5,000 Kentuckians have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. There have been at least 416,610 cases of Covid-19 since pandemic started. ##Vaccines## Former President Trump should encourage his supporters to get the Covid-19 vaccine, Adm. Brett Giroir said Monday.  “The people who follow former President are very committed to President Trump, and I think his leadership still matters a great deal,” Giroir told CNN’s Jake Tapper.   Giroir, who served as Health and Human Services assistant secretary under Trump, noted that the vaccines were developed under the Trump administration.  “I think it's very important for former President Trump, as well as the vice president to actively encourage all the followers to get the vaccine,” he said.  About 47% of people who supported Trump in the 2020 election said they would not get a Covid-19 vaccine if it became available to them, a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found.  Giroir said he did not know Trump was vaccinated until he heard it reported on the news, and is hesitant to comment on anyone’s private medical decisions. He went on to say there was a clear strategy on the day that President Biden took office and the ramp up of vaccines has been approximately the same as he would have predicted under the Trump administration.  “I think he's done some very good things and positive things, but it's built on the foundation that we built in the Trump administration,” Giroir said. “And that's the way it should be. There's no 180 degree turns.”  The idea that the Trump administration did not provide a sufficient national strategy for administering Covid-19 vaccines is “a false narrative,” he said.  “The foundation was there. There's no reason to cast aspersions,” Giroir said. “This is a great American story. A Republican administration started this, laid the foundation, the baton has been passed, and the Biden administration are taking it even to greater levels.”  Watch: China is donating 300,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to UN peacekeepers, with a priority given to peacekeeping missions in Africa, China’s ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, announced in a letter to the UN secretary general. “The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the most pressing task facing the world today,” the letter said.  “Vaccines are the most powerful weapon to win the battle. China attaches great importance to the equitable distribution of vaccines, especially the accessibility and affordability in developing countries. As of March 15th, China had provided vaccine assistance to 69 countries and two international organizations, and exported vaccines to 28 countries. More and more countries and people are benefiting from China’s vaccine,” it continued. It’s unclear which type of Covid-19 vaccine China would be donating. ##Vaccines## Connecticut is expecting to expand vaccine eligibility to people 16 and older by April 5, according to a news release from Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont’s office. The Biden administration told the state to anticipate receiving “a significant increase in supplies” of all three Covid-19 vaccines over the next few weeks, the release stated. Lamont added that by early April the state anticipates receiving more than 200,000 first doses per week.  Scheduling will open to all individuals age 45 to 54 on March 19 and tentatively on April 5, scheduling will open to those 16 and older, the release added. Currently, Connecticut is vaccinating health care workers, medical first responders, people 55 and older, residents and staff of long-term care facilities and select congregate settings, staff at pre-K-12 schools, professional child care providers, the release stated. ##Vaccines## Due to a decline in Covid-19 cases and climbing vaccination rates, Pennsylvania will ease restrictions on restaurants and businesses, and increase mass gathering limits starting April 4, according to a news release from Gov. Tom Wolf’s office Monday. Indoor dining capacity at restaurants that are self-certified or are undergoing the self-certification process will be raised to 75%, the release states. Restaurants that are not self-certified can raise their capacity to 50%. To be self-certified, restaurants must agree to strictly comply with all public health safety guidelines and orders. The curfew for removing drinks from tables will be lifted in restaurants, bar service will resume, and customers will no longer have to order food in order to purchase alcohol on April 4, according to the release.  Capacity limits for personal service facilities, gyms and entertainment facilities like casinos, malls and theaters will increase to 75%. Indoor venues will now be allowed to have up to 25% capacity and outdoor venues will be allowed 50% capacity, the release added.  Pennsylvania's Covid-19 numbers: The state reported 1,388 new cases of coronavirus Monday in addition to 1,914 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, according to data from the Department of Health.  Pennsylvania had 14 additional Covid-19 deaths over the weekend for a total of 24,587 deaths from Covid-19, the department added.  The state has administered more than 3.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with more than 1.2 million people fully vaccinated. An average of 76,000 people are being vaccinated a day. Note: These numbers were released by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. ##Restrictions## Spain joined Germany, France and Italy today in halting use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in response to a small number of people across Europe suffering blood clots – and some dying – after receiving the shot. Spain’s suspension will last for two weeks, Health Minister Carolina Darias announced at a nationally televised news conference Monday. It's a \"temporary and precautionary\" suspension, she said, \"until the risks can be evaluated by the European Medicines Agency.\" The EMA reiterated on Monday that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks and that data did not indicate people were more likely to have blood clots after receiving the vaccine. The agency has an emergency meeting on Thursday about the issue. ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## A review of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Covid-19 guidance has found that some of the agency's guidance during the Trump Administration was not grounded in science and free from undue influence, according to a statement from a CDC spokesperson. The review found that some guidance \"Used less direct language than available evidence supported\"; \"Needed to be updated to reflect the latest scientific evidence\"; and \"Presented the underlying science base for guidance inconsistently,\" according to the spokesperson. Additionally, the review identified three documents that were not primarily authored by the CDC and yet were presented as CDC documents, according to the spokesperson. The agency removed two of the documents from its website, and updated and replaced the third. The review was ordered by President Biden's CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in response to concerns about some of the CDC's guidance during the first year of the pandemic, when the Trump Administration was in charge of the agency. \"I am focused on moving CDC forward with science, transparency and clarity leading the way. It is imperative for the American people to trust CDC. If they don’t, preventable illness and injury can occur — and, tragically, lives can and will be lost,\" Walensky said in a statement to CNN. \"This agency and its critical health information cannot be vulnerable to undue influence, and this report helps outline our path to rebuilding confidence and ensuring the information that CDC shares with the American people is based on sound science that will keep us, our loved ones, and our communities healthy and safe.” News of the CDC review was first reported by The Washington Post. Europe has nearly eight million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine sitting unused, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control data shows as of Sunday. That is more than half the total number of doses distributed to European nations, the data shows. It shows 14,851,497 doses have been distributed, while 6,895,411 have been used – leaving 7,970,323 doses unused.  Only Lithuania has used its full allocation, the data shows.  The ECDC notes that member states are asked to upload data at least twice a week, on Tuesdays for the preceding week and Friday for the current week, so there may be a lag in reporting.  ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## The White House said it would welcome former President Trump's help in promoting the vaccine to his supporters but cited other ways to convince conservatives to get the shot. \"If former President Trump woke up tomorrow and wanted to be more vocal about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine certainly we’d support that,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said at a Monday press briefing. Health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have said Trump's voice in promoting the vaccine would go far in convincing Republicans to get it. Polls have shown Republicans are more likely to say they are wary or don't plan to get inoculated. Trump has made small efforts to promote the vaccine, including in a speech at CPAC, but he did not appear in a public service announcement featuring former presidents that was released last week. Psaki noted those presidents — Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter — \"did not need an engraved invitation\" to promote the vaccine. CNN reported that Trump wasn't approached to participate in the PSA, and expressed little interest in joining his predecessors to promote the vaccine. Still, Psaki said the administration was focused on using \"trusted messengers\" to convince wary populations to get the vaccine.  \"The President’s goal is to vaccine all Americans, not just those who voted for him,\" she said. \"We know we need to meet everyone where they are, and that includes conservatives.\" She said Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, would meet with evangelical leaders on Tuesday to discuss vaccines and the best way to promote them among that population. And she cited polls showing more Republicans would trust a doctor or health care provider when deciding whether to get a shot. ##Vaccines## Last week at least 52,695 new child Covid-19 cases were identified through testing, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.  However, it’s the eighth consecutive week with a decline in new cases.  Children still represent more than 13% of all cases in the US and more than 3.28 million children in the US have tested positive for Covid-19 as of Feb. 25.  Children made up between 6% and 18.6% of those who were tested for Covid-19, and 5.3% to 31% of children tested were positive for the coronavirus, depending on the state. Children are still considered much less likely than adults to develop severe symptoms of Covid-19 or to die from the disease. Children represented 1.3% to 3% of total reported hospitalizations for Covid-19, based on the information provided by 24 states and New York City. Only 0.1%-2.1% of all cases of Covid-19 in children required hospitalization.  10 states reported zero child deaths among the 43 states that provided data on Covid-19 mortality.  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that the state will be opening up Covid-19 vaccination appointments to all residents 16 and older starting Tuesday.  \"Starting tomorrow, ALL new appointments will be open to ALL Mississippians. Get your shot friends - and let’s get back to normal!\" the governor tweeted Monday.   Reeves said there will be around 10,000 appointments available over the next three weeks and encouraged those over the age of 50 to \"lock them down.\"   According to the governor's office, Reeves has been hinting that he was ready to do this for a few weeks.   \"He's been saying for a while that he was ready to open it up to anyone of any age who wants to get it. Today is the official announcement,\" the governor's press secretary Bailey Martin told CNN Monday.   See his tweet: ##Vaccines## The benefits of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risks, and the number of people developing blood clots after vaccination does not seem to be higher than in the general population, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said Monday.  The statement comes after Germany, France and Italy announced temporary suspensions of use of the vaccine. The agency said it would hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to advise on “any further actions that may need to be taken.” The EMA said last week after Denmark suspended use of the vaccine over the death of a person with a blood clot that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## Canada says it will continue with its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine despite concerns in Europe about a link between the shot and blood clots.  “Obviously we’re following what has been happening with a specific batch used in Europe but I can reassure all Canadians that no doses of AstraZeneca came from the same batch that has caused concerns in Europe,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a news conference in Montreal.  Health Canada confirmed last week that it is aware of reports of adverse events in Europe following immunization with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, but said \"the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh its risks.\"  “At this time, there is no indication that the vaccine caused these events. To date, no adverse events related to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, or the version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, have been reported to Health Canada or the Public Health Agency of Canada,” the statement posted last week said.  “The best vaccine for you to take is the first one that is offered to you,” Trudeau added Monday.  Canada’s vaccine regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot late last month, approving it for all Canadians over the age of 18, including seniors. However, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) chose not to recommend the AstraZeneca’s vaccine for people aged 65 years and older, due to what it called an insufficient amount of evidence for that age group. Canadian provinces, responsible for administering vaccines, have taken different approaches, with some restricting the AstraZeneca vaccine to those under the age of 65. Earlier Monday, Trudeau visited a mass vaccination site in downtown Montreal, a city that remains a stubborn hotspot for coronavirus infections.  Trudeau said that while he was relieved to see his mother get vaccinated in recent days, he has no firm date for receiving his own vaccine shot.  “I’m not overly focused on when my turn will come. When it comes, I will gladly get vaccinated but I will wait my turn,” he said.  ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## New York City has administered at least 2,827,436 Covid-19 vaccines to date, Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a news conference Monday, adding that the figure was “more than the population of Chicago.” De Blasio also said the city has set a goal to vaccinate any homebound residents within the next seven weeks. The city will reach out to their own list of NYC residents with disabilities to facilitate in-home vaccinations and homebound persons will be able to register for vaccinations on NYC.gov, according to Victor Calise, commissioner of the New York City Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities. On Monday, New York City recorded a 6.16% Covid-19 positivity rate with 3,123 new cases. There are currently 3.38 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people, de Blasio said. Note on the data: These numbers were released by the City of New York, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. ##Vaccines## A Dutch lab that monitors the use of pharmaceuticals says that it has received reports of 10 instances of blood clots in people who received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, but none had the low blood platelet condition reportedly observed in Norway and Denmark. Despite pausing the use of that vaccine for two weeks, the Dutch health ministry has made clear that it is still an open question whether blood clots have “any link with vaccination at all.” “Thrombosis is of course a very common complaint,” Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said Monday. “And so if you are vaccinating a large group of people, it’s not crazy that there will also be people with thrombosis after vaccination.”  “Since the media attention last Thursday, Lareb [Pharmacovigilance Center] has received 10 reports about the AstraZeneca vaccine in which thrombosis or embolism may have played a role. No lowered platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has been reported, and the specific picture has not been reported,” he said. The Lareb Pharmacovigilance Center said it had not received any reports in the Netherlands of vaccine recipients with both blood clots and lowered platelet count. ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## A person who received the AstraZeneca vaccine in Norway has died following blood clots, bleeding and a low platelet count, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said Monday. “On Saturday 13 March, Norwegian National Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Medicines Agency confirmed that three people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been admitted to (the) Rikshospitalet (hospital) with severe cases of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet count,” the agency said. “Rikshospitalet has now confirmed that one of the three has unfortunately now died.” The cases “present a rare disease picture,” the agency said: “They have a very unusual combination of low platelet counts, blood clots in small and large vessels and bleeding.” The agency said Norway had not seen similar combinations of symptoms with other vaccines.  Norway is among several European countries that have suspended the use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine while the European Union's medicines regulator investigates whether the shot could be linked to a number of reports of blood clots. ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## A growing list of European countries have suspended use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine as a precuationary measure pending review from Europe's health regulator. France became the latest country to do so, following Italy and Germany earlier today, while they await a ruling by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Tuesday afternoon.  Previous guidance from the EMA has said the benefits of the shot outweigh any potential risks. Here's a look at the European countries that have suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far: Denmark: On Thursday, Denmark suspended AstraZeneca vaccinations for 14 days as a “precautionary measure” as it investigates “signs of a possible serious side effect in the form of fatal blood clots” after one Danish person died following vaccination, according to Danish health officials. \nNorway: On Thursday, Norway chose to “pause” vaccinations following reports of the death in Denmark. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said similar cases had been reported in Norway, but “mainly in the elderly where there is often another underlying disease as well.” \nIceland: On Thursday, Iceland suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. There have been no reports of patients developing blood clots in the country. \nBulgaria: On Friday, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov ordered a halt to all AstraZeneca vaccinations until the EMA “rejects all doubts” about the vaccine's safety.\nIreland: On Sunday, Ireland decided to temporarily suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to \"maintain confidence\" in its vaccine program, according to the Chair of its National Immunization Advisory Committee. \nNetherlands: On Sunday, the Dutch government said it would pause AstraZeneca vaccinations for two weeks “as a precautionary measure and pending further investigation.” \nGermany: On Monday, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country was “precautiously” halting vaccinations with the AstraZeneca vaccine following similar moves by other European countries. \nItaly: On Monday, Italy’s medicines agency banned the use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine \"as a precaution and temporarily,\" pending a meeting of the European Medicines Agency.\nFrance: On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said they were suspending use of the vaccine until a definitive ruling from Europe's health regulator on Tuesday afternoon. “We have one principle: be guided by science and competent health authorities, and do so within a coordinated European approach,” Macron said.  Meanwhile, the UK continues to use the AstraZeneca vaccine and maintains that it is safe. Earlier Monday, the deputy head of the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunizations said there is no indication of a link between blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine and is encouraging people to continue to get the shot.  “The UK has administered 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no demonstrable difference in the number of blood clots since the vaccine was introduced,” Anthony Harnden said in a tweet posted by Public Health England. “The vaccine has been rigorously tested for safety and approved by the European Medicines Agency, MHRA and WHO, so people should continue to take it.”  ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## Italy’s medicines agency is banning the use of the AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine \"as a precaution and temporarily,\" pending a meeting of the European Medicines Agency, the Italian agency AIFA announced Monday. “AIFA has decided to extend the ban on the use of the AstraZeneca Covid19 vaccine throughout the country as a precaution and temporarily, pending the rulings of the EMA. This decision was taken in line with similar measures adopted by other European countries,” the agency said in a statement. France and Germany announced similar suspensions on Monday, while the UK said it would continue using the vaccine.  ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## France has suspended use of the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford pending review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said.  “We have decided to suspend the use of AstraZeneca as a precautionary measure and are hoping to resume it quickly if the EMA’s advice allows it,” Macron said during a news conference Monday.  “The EMA will give its assessment tomorrow afternoon on the use of this vaccine,” he added. The decision follows a number of other European countries who have suspended use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine pending further assessment, despite assertions from the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunizations  (JCVI) that the vaccine has been “rigorously tested for safety.” “We have one principle: be guided by science and competent health authorities, and do so within a coordinated European approach,” Macron concluded.  ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## There is no indication of a link between blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine, the deputy head of the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunizations said Monday, as more European countries suspended its use. “The UK has administered 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no demonstrable difference in the number of blood clots since the vaccine was introduced,” Anthony Harnden said in a tweet posted by Public Health England. “The vaccine has been rigorously tested for safety and approved by the European Medicines Agency, MHRA and WHO, so people should continue to take it.” The UK has administered nearly twice as many doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as the entire European Union plus European Economic Area, which have distributed 6.9 million doses as of Sunday, according to the ECDC. ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## More people have traveled by air in the last four days than any four-day period of the pandemic. The Transportation Security Administration says it screened 1,357,111 people at airports on Friday — a pandemic record and a number not seen since March 15, 2020.  CNN correspondent Pete Muntean answered viewers' questions from Dulles International Airport in Virginia where passengers can now get coronavirus tests before they fly. Watch:  The B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, is still projected to become the dominant variant in the United States by the end of this month or early April, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a White House briefing on Monday. \"Our current models still project that by end of March, early April, B.1.1.7 will be the dominant variant,\" Walensky said. At least 4,858 cases of coronavirus variants first spotted in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been reported in the United States, according to data updated Sunday by the CDC. Most of these cases, 4,690, are the more contagious variant known as B.1.1.7. This variant has been found in 48 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC. Walensky said on Monday that \"in some states, Florida and California, it's up to 25%, and in other states it's lower.\" CDC says this does not represent the total number of such cases circulating in the US, but rather just those that have been found by analyzing positive samples. The agency cautions that its numbers may not immediately match those of state and local health departments. ##Variants## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reviewing new data to see if physical distancing rules in schools should be changed to advise people to stay at least 3 feet apart instead of at least 6 feet apart, according to a federal official. The official pointed to a study published last week that showed “no significant difference” in rates of Covid-19 at Massachusetts public schools that had implemented social distancing rules of more than 3 feet apart compared to those with rules to stay more than 6 feet apart. “CDC has reviewed the data from this study and is completing additional studies looking at Covid transmission in schools, and when those studies are complete and CDC has done additional analysis, if necessary the agency will update its guidance to reflect the most up to date science regarding Covid and schools,” the official said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, was asked about the study by CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday. “The CDC is very well aware that data are accumulating making it look more like 3 feet are okay, under certain circumstances. They're analyzing that and I can assure you within a reasonable period of time – quite reasonable – they will be giving guidelines according to the data that they have. It won't be very long,” Fauci said. More on the study: In the study, published Wednesday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, researchers at Harvard Medical School and Boston University School of Medicine and their colleagues looked at data from 537,336 students in 251 Massachusetts school districts and did not find a difference in Covid-19 rates between schools that mandated at least 3 feet of physical distance compared to 6 feet – as long as everyone wore masks. The study notes that while the CDC recommends 6 feet or more between students, the World Health Organization recommends 1 meter, which is 3.3 feet, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 3-6 feet. “Lower physical distancing policies can be adopted in school settings with masking mandates without negatively impacting student or staff safety,” the authors concluded. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is urging the public to continue wearing masks, physical distancing and other Covid-19 safety measures During a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Monday, Walensky warned that some European countries have seen a resurgence of Covid-19 cases after relaxing mitigation measures. These countries have had \"strikingly similar\" Covid-19 trends and surges during the pandemic as the United States, Walensky said. With clocks springing ahead over the weekend, a recent surge in travel and the beginning of spring break, Walensky said she now worries that the United States could see a spike in Covid-19 cases as well. \"We have seen footage of people enjoying spring break festivities, maskless. This is all in the context of still 50,000 cases per day,\" Walensky said on Monday. \"I'm pleading with you for the sake of our nation's health,\" Walensky said. \"These should be warning signs for all of us – cases climbed last spring, they climbed again in the summer, they will climb now if we stop taking precautions when we get more and more people vaccinated,\" she added. CDC director: We still have much work to do ##Hotspots## The Biden administration announced it will increase Medicare reimbursement for Covid-19 shots, another step toward the administration’s goal of more equitable vaccine distribution.  “We’re announcing that the Biden administration will nearly double Medicare’s reimbursement rates for administering Covid vaccines from about $23 per shot to $40 per shot. That’s $80 total for a two dose vaccine,” White House senior Covid adviser Andy Slavitt said at Monday’s Covid briefing.  The move, Slavitt said, will “make it easier for more healthcare providers to get out into communities and give more Covid shots to people in need,” which will help get vaccines to the nation’s underserved communities more expeditiously. Slavitt also explained that through the Covid relief bill, the administration will also be covering 100% of the cost for Medicaid and children’s health insurance beneficiaries to get vaccinated. “It means that vaccines will continue to be free to you. You do not need insurance to get vaccinated, you do not need cash or a credit card or worry about a copayment or deductible. You will not get a bill. The vaccines are free, they’re safe, and they’re effective,” he said, adding, “That also means that doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers you trust will be out in your communities administering vaccines… because the federal government will now pay them more for each shot they deliver.” ##Vaccines## A new study published Monday provides additional evidence that severe Covid-19 can affect brain function.  The study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, used advanced techniques to examine the brains of people with severe Covid-19. The study found that patients with severe Covid-19 – and no other clear reason for their neurologic symptoms – were more likely to have movement disorders such as tremor or seizures, frontal lobe syndrome or brainstem impairment, which can cause problems with planning and social behavior. These patients were defined as having Covid-19-related encephalopathy, or CORE. “In our study, we showed that patients with CORE mostly had movement disorders (mainly seizures and/or myorrhythmia), brainstem impairment (oculomotor disorders such as head bobbing) and frontal syndrome (disinhibition and grasping),” the researchers wrote. The study was conducted at a single hospital in Paris between March 30 and June 11, 2020. It included 78 patients with severe Covid-19 who also underwent a special test looking at electrical firing of brain cells during their hospitalization, called an electroencephalogram, or EEG. Many, but not all, of these patients also had other advanced imaging techniques performed, such as brain magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI Of the 78 patients included in the study, nine were found to have CORE While the cause of brain changes in people with severe Covid-19 is unknown, the findings reinforce the hypothesis that the virus could be invading the frontal lobe through nerves in the nose, the researchers said. The researchers also developed a tool using the patient’s clinical presentation, EEG and MRI to predict which people are more likely to develop CORE. But more research on CORE is needed to determine the utility of such a tool. The 2021 Masters Par 3 Contest will not be played when the tournament begins next month due to social distancing protocols, Augusta National announced on Monday.  The club hopes the event will resume in 2022. The annual contest, which usually occurs the day before the start of the Masters tournament, was canceled last year as well after the tournament was moved from April to November because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 85th Masters, scheduled for April 8 to 11 in Augusta, Georgia, will have a limited, unspecified number of spectators.  The tournament will have similar health and safety standards to those instituted last November.   ##Restrictions## Moderna announced it has launched an early-stage trial of an updated Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine is refrigerator stable, so it would be easier to distribute. The company is testing it as a single-dose vaccine as well as testing it as a double dose. “Our investments in our mRNA platform have enabled us to develop this next generation vaccine candidate, which is a potential refrigerator-stable vaccine that could facilitate easier distribution and administration in a wider range of settings, including potentially for developing countries. We remain committed to helping address this ongoing public health emergency,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a news release Monday. In future trials, Moderna said that the company will also test this version of the vaccine to see if it could work as a booster. Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have said that they will be testing boosters, in case their current vaccines aren’t as effective against variants. ##Vaccines## Most people who have received a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine are getting their second dose on time, according to early data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But CDC researchers warn that the initial groups prioritized to receive the vaccine – health care workers and long-term care facility residents – have had easy access to a second dose through their workplace or residence. \"As priority groups broaden, adherence to the recommended dosing interval might decrease,\" the researchers wrote in their report published on Monday.  For the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, it is recommended for second doses to be administered 21 and 28 days later, respectively, but the researchers noted in their report that up to 42 days between doses is permissible if needed. The report includes data on more than 37 million people who received at least their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine between Dec. 14 and Feb. 14. The researchers analyzed the data, taking a close look at when the first dose was received, whether a second dose was received and whether that second dose was received on time. The data came from 58 jurisdictions across the United States. The researchers found that among those where enough time had gone by to receive a second dose, 88% of people had completed their second dose, 8.6% had not but there was still enough time to receive their second dose, and 3.4% had missed the second dose completely – meaning at least 42 days had gone by since receiving their first dose. Among those in the data who had received both doses, the researchers found that 95.6% received their second dose within the recommended time interval. The researchers noted that several winter weather events led to distribution challenges and vaccination clinics canceling appointments during the study, and more research is needed to examine the completion of second doses over a longer period of time. \"Continued monitoring of series completion status across jurisdictions and by demographic characteristics is important to ensure equity in vaccine administration and vaccination coverage, especially as vaccination efforts expand to additional population groups,\" the researchers wrote.  ##Vaccines## Germany is “precautiously” halting vaccinations with the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to CNNs German affiliate n-tv.   “The decision today is purely a precautionary measure. It is a purely scientific and not a political decision. And that's why I'm following the recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, ” a statement by German Health Minister Jens Spahn said. \"In order to maintain confidence in the vaccine, we have to give our experts in Germany and the EU the time to review the latest incidents.We are pausing to check. The result of the check is open and that's why we are now counting on the EMA, ideally, coming to its decision and recommendation in the course of this week,\" he continued. \"The PEI (Paul-Ehrlich-Institute) advises that people who have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca & feel increasingly unwell more than 4 days after vaccination - e.g. with severe and persistent headaches or punctiform skin bleeding - should seek medical treatment immediately. It has happened very rarely. So far there have been 7 reported cases that may be related to such a cerebral vein thrombosis and that meanwhile over 1.6 million vaccinations in Germany.\" Germany is now the seventh European country to suspend AstraZeneca's use despite advice from the European Union's medicines regulator that the benefits of the shot outweigh any potential risks. Here's a look at the other EU countries that have suspended use: Denmark: On Thursday, March 11, Denmark suspended AstraZeneca vaccinations for 14 days as a “precautionary measure” as it investigates “signs of a possible serious side effect in the form of fatal blood clots” after one Danish person died following vaccination, according to Danish health officials. \nNorway: On Thursday, March 11, Norway chose to “pause” vaccinations following reports of the death in Denmark. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said similar cases had been reported in Norway, but “mainly in the elderly where there is often another underlying disease as well.” \nIceland: On Thursday, March 11, Iceland suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. There have been no reports of patients developing blood clots in the country. \nBulgaria: On Friday, March 12, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov ordered a halt to all AstraZeneca vaccinations until the EMA “rejects all doubts” about the vaccine's safety.\nIreland: On Sunday, March 14, Ireland decided to temporarily suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to \"maintain confidence\" in its vaccine program, according to the Chairman of its National Immunization Advisory Committee. \nNetherlands: On Sunday, March 14, the Dutch government said it would pause AstraZeneca vaccinations for two weeks “as a precautionary measure and pending further investigation.”   ##AstraZeneca## ##Vaccines## More coronavirus testing facilities are opening up at airports as pandemic air travel continues to break records. Two testing locations opened up before security at Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport on Monday morning. The new partnership is between the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and XpresCheck—the company known for its in-airport XpresSpa chain. The new locations are the tenth and eleventh at airports across the country. Passengers can pay $200 to get a rapid molecular test for while-you-wait results or $75 to get to get an Abbot ID Now PCR with results in one to three days. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says both international and domestic travelers should get tested before and after their trip. “Infrastructure like this in airports is going to be part of the new normal that give people comfort,” XpresCheck CEO Doug Satzman tells CNN. He says the company will also roll out a rapid PCR test in April. Saltzman says those who test positive will be told to quarantine either at home or a hotel and their information will be referred to the CDC in hopes that passengers are prevented from boarding a plane. The CDC says it maintains a public health Do Not Board list, which is independent of the TSA-administered Do Not Fly list. “We have a special, expedited process - because of the nature of this environment - that prevents somebody from going through security and boarding the plane,” said Saltzman. Top Biden medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday gave his view on a new Massachusetts study that found \"no significant difference\" between six feet of physical distancing versus three feet of physical distancing in schools. On CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Jake Tapper pressed Fauci on the research. Fauci said the findings do indicate to him that three feet of distancing is good enough and that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of the new data. \"I can tell you and promise you, I talk to the CDC, to (Director Rochelle Walensky) every single day,\" he said. \"She is acutely aware of the accumulation of data and the fact that her team will be acting on the data the way they always do.\" President Biden will announce today that Gene Sperling, a former top economic official in the last two Democratic presidential administrations, will serve as the point person in overseeing the implementation of the newly signed $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, according to two people briefed on the plan and a senior administration official. Biden will announce Sperling's appointment at the White House today at 1:45 p.m. ET during remarks about implementation of the law, according to the senior administration official. Sperling's mandate will be to get money out the door quickly and maximize its impact, the people said, while also serving as the lead official in partnership with state and local officials on the receiving end of billions of dollars from the law. He will serve as the lead in advising and ensuring local officials get what they need, while also holding them accountable for any mismanagement of funds, the individuals briefed on the plan said. Sperling has spent more than a decade at the highest levels of government, twice serving as the director of the National Economic Council, and will be tasked with ensuring all aspects of the sweeping relief law are put into place as designed. In the next few weeks, the Biden administration will also launch a national vaccine promotional campaign aimed at encouraging hesitant Americans to get immunized, a marketing executive close to the project told CNN. The advertisements are part of a $250 million Covid-19 education campaign run by the US Department of Health and Human Services, which will include a podcast hosted by \"a well-known person\" outside of government, the executive said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats took a beating in two state elections on Sunday amid growing public anger over the country's sluggish vaccination rollout and a corruption scandal involving face mask production. The historic losses come two months after the CDU elected a new party leader, Armin Laschet, and six months before a national vote that will see Merkel leave office after nearly two decades in power. Merkel's successor has not yet been chosen and Laschet will face serious questions over whether he is the right candidate to take her place on the ticket in September.  Commenting on the results in Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg, states once considered party strongholds, Laschet said the CDU would have to do better work managing the coronavirus crisis. The dual defeats are being seen, in part, as a reaction to the pace of Germany's Covid-19 vaccination program, which has been dogged by supply shortages and bureaucracy. So far, the country of over 83 million people has administered less than nine million vaccinations -- making it one of the slowest rollouts in Europe.  Frustration over the government's handling of Covid-19 has been exacerbated by a recent face mask procurement scandal. Several lawmakers in Merkel's conservative-led coalition have stepped down in recent days after accusations that they had received payments for securing face mask deals. And after months of varying coronavirus restrictions and lockdowns, Germany is facing yet another surge in infections. ##Hotspots## ##Vaccines## A third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is threatening parts of Europe, forcing governments to reinstate restrictions first issued one year ago. New variants of the coronavirus have been blamed for a spike in cases in France, Italy, Germany and Poland. The infection rate in the European Union is surging -- now at the highest level in weeks. Much of Italy was put in lockdown on Monday, with people only permitted out of their homes for essential errands. The restrictions will last through Easter weekend, when the entire country will become a red zone. “More than a year after the start of the health emergency, we are unfortunately facing a new wave of infections,” Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Friday, after announcing the new measures, news agency Agence France Presse reported. “The memory of what happened last spring is vivid, and we will do everything to prevent it from happening again,” he added. In France, authorities are under pressure from doctors to issue more restrictions as the country grapples with a surge in cases that has pushed intensive care units in the Paris region to the brink.  French President Emmanuel Macron has issued restrictions and curfews for several regions, but has stopped short of a nationwide lockdown. But on Sunday, Prime Minister Jean Castex said that if a lockdown was necessary he would “do it,\" while urging the French to get vaccinated, Twitch website reported.   On Monday, French newspapers marked the one-year anniversary of the country's first lockdown. “One year of Covid, 90,000 dead, a great loss,” read the cover of left-wing newspaper Liberation. In the background were the names and ages of the deceased.  ##Hotspots## The Netherlands on Sunday became the latest European nation to suspend AstraZeneca vaccinations over blood clot concerns despite advice from the European Union's medicines regulator that the benefits of the shot outweigh any potential risks.  Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria and Ireland have also halted the vaccinations. Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said on Monday that a “rare combination” of blood clots and lowered blood platelets in several AstraZeneca vaccine recipients in Norway and Denmark was “enough reason” to pause use of the vaccine in the Netherlands for two weeks. While any causality remains an open question, reports about six cases in Norway and Denmark had given the Netherlands' medicine authority enough reason \"to press the pause button,” de Jonge said. “Thrombosis is of course a very common complaint. And so if you are vaccinating a large group of people, it’s not crazy that there will also be people with thrombosis after vaccination. But in this case it is a very rare combination of thrombosis in which bleeding can also occur due to a reduced number of platelets,” he added. The Health Minister had said as recently as Thursday that blood clots were occurring “not because of vaccination,” and that there was “no cause for concern.” In a letter to parliament sent on Sunday, de Jonge wrote that the pause would be in effect until March 29, “pending further advice from the EMA,\" or European Medicines Agency. The EMA on Thursday advised that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks, and did not recommend suspending its use while investigation into thromboembolic events are ongoing.  The EMA said it was aware that Denmark was suspending AstraZeneca vaccinations due to reports of blood clots in people who had received it, but said: “There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine.”  The Danish Medicines Agency on Monday said the woman who died of a blood clot after receiving AstraZeneca in Denmark had an “unusual picture of illness around the death,” with a low number of platelets, blood clots in small and large vessels and bleeding. “The clinical picture is highly unusual and is currently being thoroughly investigated by the European Medicines Agency,\" the agency said in a statement. Denmark is one of six European countries to suspend AstraZeneca's use despite the EMA's recommendation.   Denmark: On Thursday, March 11, Denmark suspended AstraZeneca vaccinations for 14 days as a “precautionary measure” as it investigates “signs of a possible serious side effect in the form of fatal blood clots” after one Danish person died following vaccination, according to Danish health officials. \nNorway: On Thursday, March 11, Norway chose to “pause” vaccinations following reports of the death in Denmark. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said similar cases had been reported in Norway, but “mainly in the elderly where there is often another underlying disease as well.” \nIceland: On Thursday, March 11, Iceland suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. There have been no reports of patients developing blood clots in the country. \nBulgaria: On Friday, March 12, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov ordered a halt to all AstraZeneca vaccinations until the EMA “rejects all doubts” about the vaccine's safety.\nIreland: On Sunday, March 14, Ireland decided to temporarily suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to \"maintain confidence\" in its vaccine program, according to the Chairman of its National Immunization Advisory Committee. \nNetherlands: On Sunday, March 14, the Dutch government said it would pause AstraZeneca vaccinations for two weeks “as a precautionary measure and pending further investigation.”  ##Vaccines## ##AstraZeneca## China has administered 64.98 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of Sunday, health authorities said Monday. The Chinese government hopes to vaccinate 40% of the country's 1.4 billion people by June, respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan said previously. Four domestic-made vaccines have been approved for conditional public use in China, two produced by state-owned Sinopharm, one by Sinovac Biotech and another by CanSinoBio. ##Vaccines## Hong Kong will expand its coronavirus vaccination drive to include people aged 30 to 59, authorities announced Monday, as the city faces a growing cluster of infections linked to a gym. The expanded vaccine program, effective from Tuesday, will also include students over 16 years old studying abroad and domestic workers. It is expected to cover about 5.5 million of the city's roughly 7 million population. The city will also open 12 more centers for the Fosun-BioNTech vaccine starting Tuesday. Speaking at a news conference Monday, the city's officials said vaccination rates are currently “good” and that they may consider further relaxing social distancing rules if the public complies with measures such as mask-wearing. Papua New Guinea reported 90 new Covid-19 cases Saturday, continuing a recent surge in infections that is raising concerns in the Pacific Island nation and in neighboring Australia. Following a rise in cases since late February, PNG has now reported 2,173 total infections, with 21 related deaths, a government news release said Monday.  Addressing a news conference Monday, the leader of Australia's Queensland state,  Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she hoped to speak with PNG Prime Minister James Marape in the next 24 hours. “We have major concerns about what’s happening in Papua New Guinea.” Palaszczuk said.\n\"We have been assisting with some [Covid-19] tests in Papua New Guinea and out of the 500 tests that our health authorities have done for Papua New Guinea, 250 have come back positive\", she added. The controller of the PNG Covid-19 national pandemic response, Police Commissioner David Manning, called on everyone in the country to follow the health measures in place to prevent further spread of the virus. “We must do all we can to ensure this virus does not spread to the rural and remote areas of our country,\" Manning said in the National Health Department’s news release. On March 9, Marape, the PNG Prime Minister, announced regulatory approval for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, adding “we are now in the process of getting the vaccine across, hopefully by April”. ##Hotspots## About 100 people have been arrested and two police officers injured as spring break crowds gathered in Florida's Miami Beach over the weekend, the city says. Miami Beach Police arrested 30 people Saturday night, following Friday night's unruly crowds that resulted in two Miami Beach police officers being sent to the hospital with injuries, the police department said in a post on Twitter. Friday night's incident involved a large crowd which was \"disorderly and surrounding officers,\" another tweet said. Miami Beach police tweeted that they used pepper balls to disperse the group. CNN affiliate WPLG reported that Miami Beach police officers are working 12-hour shifts. The weekend's approximately 100 arrests included some for the seizure of weapons and drugs, city of Miami Beach spokeswoman Veronica Payssé told CNN on Sunday. Read the full story:  The Netherlands has joined a growing list of countries suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine following reports of possible side effects post inoculation. The Dutch government said Sunday it will pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for  two weeks “as a precautionary measure and pending further investigation.” The decision came just days after Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said there was “no cause for concern,” and that vaccinations could continue. In a statement Sunday, the Dutch Health Ministry said its Medicines Evaluations Board (CBG) had received “new information” over the weekend.  The statement said as yet no “causal relationship” has been established between the vaccine and the newly reported side effects from Denmark and Norway, but that it would pause use of the AstraZeneca vaccine until March 29. “The CBG indicates that a total of six new reports of possible side effects have been received from Denmark and Norway. These are serious, rare signs of clot formation (thrombosis) and a reduced number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) in adults under age 50,\" the statement said, adding that no such cases have yet occurred in the Netherlands.\n“The crucial question is whether this is about complaints after vaccination, or caused by vaccination,” De Jonge said in the statement. “There cannot be a single doubt about the vaccines.” AstraZeneca has robustly defended its vaccine, saying in a statement Sunday there were no confirmed quality issues for any batch of the drug, and \"no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia\" for people who had received it. Some context: The Netherlands is the latest European country to partially or fully suspend its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine following reports of patients developing blood clots after inoculations. Austria was the first to sound the alarm on the potential dangers of the vaccine, suspending one batch of doses last Tuesday.\nItaly banned the use of vaccines from a specific batch of AstraZeneca doses last Friday, after a man in Sicily died of cardiac arrest one day after receiving his first dose of the vaccine.\nDenmark became the first European country to temporarily suspend the entire rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine last Thursday, followed by Iceland, Norway and Ireland. The European Union's medicines regulator, the EMA, is currently investigating whether the shot could be linked to a number of reports of blood clots. ##Vaccines##  ##AstraZeneca## Federal Covid-19 guidelines \"will be much more liberal\" by the Fourth of July if US cases drop as more Americans are vaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday. \"If by the time we get to the Fourth of July, with the rollout of the vaccine, we get the level of infection so low -- I'm not going to be able to tell you exactly what the specific guidelines of the (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) are, but I can tell you for sure (guidelines) will be much more liberal than they are right now about what you can do,\" the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\" Asked whether people will return to a degree of normalcy without masks and distancing by the summer holiday, Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, replied: \"Yes ... there will be a greater degree of confidence\" in that. The comments from Fauci come nearly a week after the CDC released new guidance saying people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can safely visit with other vaccinated people and small groups of unvaccinated people in some circumstances. The agency is still urging unvaccinated Americans to socially distance from people who don't live in their home, wear masks and avoid crowds, measures that have been critical to slowing the spread of the deadly virus over the past year.

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"US Covid-19 cases rise as Delta variant spreads","date":"Jul 29, 2021","text":"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday that she did not expect the American people to welcome the agency’s new mask guidance.  She urged people to get vaccinated and mask up for now to avoid the need for continued masking.  “This was not news that I expected the American people to welcome,” Walensky said in an appearance on Fox News. “This weighed heavily on me to have to do this.” ­­ The CDC recommended Tuesday that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with \"substantial\" or \"high\" transmission of Covid-19 – more than half of all US counties. The agency cited the rapid spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant, which in some cases has been transmitted by fully vaccinated people. “I have no interest in continuing mask guidance, and the best way to stop a new variant from spreading is to have less virus out there, and the best way to do that is to get people vaccinated and to mask up until they are,” she said. ##Masks## President Biden said the US will “in all probability” see more guidelines and restrictions following rising Covid-19 cases and the emerging spread of the Delta variant. “And by the way, we had a good day yesterday,” Biden said, before departing the White House for Camp David. “Almost a million people got vaccinated, about half a million of those people for the first time, and for the second shot, and so I’m hopeful that people are beginning to realize how essential it is to move.” When asked if the US was headed for more lockdowns due to rising cases, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed the concern, telling reporters at the briefing, “the way we see this is that we have the tools in our tool belt to fight this ... variant,” adding, “we are not going to head towards a lockdown.” “Our goal is to make sure that we are we are not headed towards that, that is not going to be the direction that we take, because we have the tools to prevent that,” Jean-Pierre said, pointing to the availability of free vaccines across the country. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued an executive order that directs the state's health and education departments to issue emergency rules that prevent the implementation of a mask mandate in schools.  A news release from the governor's office said that executive order 21-175 was issued \"in response to several Florida school boards considering or implementing mask mandates in their schools after the Biden administration issued unscientific and inconsistent recommendations that school-aged children wear masks.\" It added that this was done \"to protect parents’ freedom to choose whether their children wear masks.\"  The executive order states that if the State Board of Education finds a school district board unwilling or unable to comply, they are able to withhold the transfer of state funds,  discretionary grant funds, or discretionary lottery funds until they do. They may also declare the school ineligible for competitive grants. The latest data: DeSantis' order comes after the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention unveiled guidance earlier this week that people in areas with \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission should resume wearing masks indoors. Over 75% of the US population live in these areas. The CDC released a new study Friday that shows the Delta Covid-19 variant produced similar amounts of virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they get infected. The finding that the Delta variant resulted in similar viral loads \"was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said Friday. \"The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones,\" the CDC director said. ##Masks## New evidence about the contagiousness of the Delta variant shows it’s more important than ever to get vaccinated, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study earlier Friday showing that three-quarters of people infected during an outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, were vaccinated. Most cases involved the Delta variant. And infected people who were vaccinated had just as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated patients did. “What we did know was how transmissible the virus was among unvaccinated people,” Fauci told NPR. “So it was very clear that when you compare the Delta variant with, for example, the Alpha variant, it was clearly, considerably more transmissible. The new data show that it is so transmissible that even a vaccinated person who has a breakthrough infection can now transmit it. That is the new data.” The Provincetown study prompted the CDC to change its guidance on mask use and advise vaccinated people to resume mask use indoors in areas of sustained or high transmission of the virus. “There's a difference between knowing that is transmissible in general versus it's also transmissible when you have a breakthrough infection of a vaccinated person,” Fauci said. “I think the simplest way to get people to understand is that we are dealing with a different virus,” he added. “The Delta virus has characteristics that's different than the Alpha variant and other variants we've dealt with. So when someone says the war is changed, what it really means [is that] the virus has changed. And we have got to keep up in our understanding, and what our policies are related to the fact that we're dealing now with a more formidable virus.” Some background: The Alpha, or B.1.1.7 variant, dominated the US until early summer. Now Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, accounts for more than 80% of cases, according to the CDC. It’s driven a fresh surge of infections. “The solution to all of this is to get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can,” Fauci said. “There’s a really, really good reason to get vaccinated, and that is to save yourself from getting a severe infection that would lead to hospitalization and deaths.\" “There's one striking number that people who choose to remain unvaccinated should remember: in the United States… look at all of the Covid deaths, 99.5% of them occur among unvaccinated people, and 0.5% occur among vaccinated people. So if ever there was a statistic that's striking, to tell you the difference between a vaccinated and unvaccinated person, that's it,\" Fauci added. ##Vaccines## Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is warning consumers to be aware of potential price gouging on goods, products, and services following Gov. Asa Hutchinson's Covid-19 public health emergency declaration.  “Just as we saw in 2020, some people will exploit a crisis by charging astronomical amounts for items like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, but this illegal activity will not be tolerated on my watch,” said Rutledge in a news release. “Unfortunately, during emergency declarations, we must be diligent and report businesses charging prices for items that appear beyond legal limits.” Rutledge released tips in a news release to avoid price gouging, including knowing the average price for goods like hand sanitizer, soap and non-perishable food items before purchasing.  The state's price gouging law bans businesses from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged for essential goods and services during emergencies. Arkansas businesses may legally charge a higher price if they can show that the higher price is directly attributable to additional costs incurred by the retailer, its supplier or as the result of additional costs for labor or materials. The Walt Disney Company is requiring full Covid-19 vaccinations for all salaried and non-union hourly employees working at sites in US, the company said in a statement Friday. The company will give employees who aren’t vaccinated and working on-site 60 days to get vaccinated, according to the statement. Employees working from home will need to provide verification of vaccination before returning to work, the company said, with limited exceptions.  All new hires will be required to be fully vaccinated before beginning employment, the company said. Discussions with unions representing employees under collective bargaining agreements have also begun, the company said. “Vaccines are the best tool we all have to help control this global pandemic and protect our employees,” the company said. ##Vaccines## More than 84,400 vaccination doses were administered over the last 24 hours in New York state, according to a news release from Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office.  This is higher than the daily average during the month of July, which was just over 31,900.    The seven-day positivity average for Covid-19 cases remains over 2% in the state. The highest rate is in the capital region at 3.21%, according to the release. The rise in vaccinations comes after Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced certain vaccine requirements for state and city workers this week. To note: The July vaccination average of 31,907 was computed by adding up all of the daily vaccine doses reported by the New York State Department of Health via the governor’s press office and dividing by total number of days. The US Food and Drug Administration is pulling in extra help from across the agency to speed final approval of Pfizer/BioNtech’s coronavirus vaccine, an agency spokesperson told CNN Friday. “We have taken an all-hands-on-deck approach, including identifying additional resources such as personnel and technological resources from across the agency and opportunities to reprioritize other activities, in order to complete our review to help combat this pandemic surge,” the FDA’s Abby Capobianco told CNN in an email. “Our ongoing review of the biologics license application for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is moving forward as rapidly as possible in keeping with the high-quality complete assessment that the public expects from the FDA,” she added. The three vaccines in current use in the United States — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s and Johnson & Johnson’s — have emergency use authorization. Pfizer has filed for full approval in a process known as biologics license application or BLA.  “We recognize that for some, the FDA approval of COVID-19 vaccines may bring additional confidence and encourage them to get vaccinated,” Capobianco said. She said acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock was helping reassign people and other resources. “FDA staff will conduct a thorough review process, while balancing the incredible sense of urgency necessary, both of which are needed to ensure that any vaccine that is authorized or approved meets our rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness, and quality. In this regard, Dr. Woodcock has reiterated her appreciation for the diligence and integrity to this process and offered all agency resources to the team to make this happen.” ##Vaccines## The White House is not considering a national vaccine requirement at this time, principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at Friday’s press briefing. Jean-Pierre declined to say whether President Biden has asked the Department of Justice if a federal vaccine mandate was possible, telling reporters Friday, “I don't have any more to add to that,” but pointed to the President’s remarks Thursday during remarks from the East Room. “I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is, they're able to [pass vaccine mandates] legally,” Biden said Thursday, “and they can, local communities can do that, local businesses can do that. It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet.” ##Vaccines## More than 80% of the US population — about 274 million people — live in a county considered to have “high” or “substantial” Covid-19 transmission, according to a CNN analysis of data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includes more than half of the US population — nearly 55% — who live in areas with \"high\" transmission, and another 28% live in counties with \"substantial\" transmission.  That’s about 25 million additional people since Thursday who live in a county where, according to the latest CDC guidance, even fully vaccinated people should mask up indoors. Less than 1% of the population — fewer than 2 million people — live in areas with “low” transmission.   The CDC considers a county to have “high” transmission if there have been 100 or more cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 residents in the past week, or a test positivity rate of 10% or higher during the same time frame. For “low” transmission, those numbers must be fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 or a test positivity rate under 5%. ##Masks## White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the administration’s communication efforts after it updated Covid-19 guidance following rising cases and the dominance of the Delta variant, telling reporters at Friday’s briefing that while they haven’t held a Covid-19 briefing this week or had any health officials join the White House briefings, “I would argue that we had the President of the United States speak to this yesterday, he gave a more than 30 minute speech about where we are as a country.” “We heard from the President yesterday, we heard from the President about the Delta variant and vaccinations in general the day before yesterday when he was in Pennsylvania where he was supposed to talk about ‘Buy American,’ which he did, but he led off talking about the vaccinations, we have had our doctors on your networks on many of the networks that are here talking probably all of them, talking about the Delta variant, all throughout these last couple of days, so they have been out there, they've been talking about it,” Jean-Pierre said. “The doctors have been on national television all week, speaking to this, answering the questions on your networks, so they've been out there talking about, they're not hiding,” she added. Jean-Pierre also told reporters, “our message has always been clear throughout — we need more people to get vaccinated to stop the spread of this variant, and so, we have to continue to make that effort.” Jean-Pierre also pointed to data released by the CDC today in their weekly Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that led to new mask guidance, telling reporters Friday, “The CDC’s first and foremost priority is getting the American people information as quickly as possible, and so, that's what they did on Tuesday, they got it as quickly as they can.” “They're going to be releasing this data today, as you know, and it was clear that the vaccine — it was clear that vaccinated people have the ability to transmit, and action needed to be taken quickly, and that's why they did it.”  ##Masks## The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded the use of Regeneron’s antibody therapy so it could be used as a preventative treatment for certain people who have been exposed to Covid-19, the company said on Friday. The FDA’s expanded authorization will allow the antibody treatment to be used in people who are not fully vaccinated or are not expected to mount an adequate immune response after they have been exposed to someone who is infectious or for those who are at high risk of exposure to someone with Covid-19 in an institutional setting. It is not authorized as a substitute for vaccination, the FDA said. Regeneron’s late-stage trial data showed an 81% reduced risk of symptomatic infections in people who came into close contact with someone with Covid-19.  Regeneron’s antibody therapy is the only one that is currently authorized to be used both to treat and prevent Covid-19 infections. It was the treatment given to former President Trump when he became infected last year, as well as several other high-profile politicians. The initial authorization allowed doctors to use the treatment for any patient who is 12 years old or older who tests positive for Covid-19 and is at high risk for severe disease, but is not yet hospitalized. In May, the US stopped the distribution of Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody treatment since it didn’t seem to be as effective against virus variants. At least one Trauma Service Area (TSA) in Texas had zero intensive care unit beds available on Wednesday, according to the most recent data available on the Texas Department of State Health Services Covid-19 Tests and Hospitals dashboard. Area N, located around Bryan, Texas which is north of Houston and east of Austin, showed no available ICU beds and 49 available hospital beds on the dashboard. The dashboard shows Area T, which includes Laredo, had one ICU bed and five available hospital beds left. At least seven other TSAs had less than ten ICU beds left, the dashboard reports. Those include areas around Amarillo, Wichita Falls, Abilene, Killeen, Waco, Beaumont, and Victoria, according to the dashboard. AdventHealth has elevated its Covid-19 status to \"black\" due to increased hospitalizations in the Central Florida network. This means that all non-emergency inpatient and outpatient surgeries and procedures will be rescheduled. Time-sensitive pediatric procedures will be carried out with the approval of AdventHealth's chief medical officer.  Over 90% of the Covid-19 patients currently hospitalized are unvaccinated, AdventHealth Central Florida Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Neil Finkler said at a news conference Friday. \"None of these patients thought they would get the virus, but the Delta variant has proven to be so highly contagious that even the young and the healthy, including pregnant patients, are now starting to fill up our hospitals,\" he said. Finkler said that those vaccinated people who end up being hospitalized are there because they have comorbidities that would put them at risk because their immune system is not functioning normally.  \"For the most part, this has really been a tale of two cities,\" Finkler said. \"It's the unvaccinated that are in the hospital. It's by and large the unvaccinated that get ill, it's the unvaccinated that require intubations, as well as further, life-saving support. Those that are in the hospital that are vaccinated, again, we understand for the most part why they're there, because their immune systems aren't normal.\" The World Health Organization is in “very positive” discussions with countries – including China – on the direction of the next phase of its investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, said on Friday.  “I think we're (in) very positive consultations now with a large number of member states, including our colleagues in China, to look at what we need to move forward next,” Ryan said at a WHO news briefing. Following the Phase 1 report on the mission, “Many, many studies were proposed going forward, and we do know our Chinese colleagues are implementing some, if not all, of those studies at the moment,” he said. “We’re expecting all countries, all member states of WHO, to cooperate and support this process. And I suspect that we will get that cooperation.” Ryan specifically warned against a “politicized” investigation. “The one consistent thing we've heard from all countries has been, ‘Let's not politicize the science,’ and the next thing that happens is the science is politicized,” Ryan said. “We want to reassure our colleagues in China that this process is still, and is, and has always been, driven by science,” he continued.   “We have stuck to the principles of the process of this from the very beginning, we've not ceded to pressures on one side or the other. The (director-general) has tried to steer at a path that has been driven by science, by evidence, taking no sides, and trying to reach the objectives that we all want,” Ryan added. CNN's chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta broke down the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new study about the Delta Covid-19 variant spread— and what its findings could mean for vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans across the country.  \"The idea that people who were vaccinated still were far less likely to develop severe symptoms, hospitalizations, deaths, all the things that we've talked about since the vaccines were first authorized, remain true. The vaccines work, in that regard, but the idea that someone [who is vaccinated] could test positive and still develop enough virus in their nose and mouth to transmit is really what this data is showing,\" Gupta told CNN's Ana Cabrera following the release of the study.  The study, published by CDC Friday, describes 469 Massachusetts residents who were infected in a July outbreak in Barnstable County, which includes the summer vacation destination Provincetown. No deaths were reported among them. About 74% — or 346 cases —had been fully vaccinated. Of those cases, 79% reported symptoms. Genetically sequenced cases revealed the Delta variant as the main culprit. \"I still want to reiterate just how effective the vaccines can be at doing the things that people I think looked for them to do the most. Prevent severe hospitalization and death. But it is clear that this Delta variant is far more transmissible and as a result of that, probably even vaccinated people are transmitting this at a higher rate than we thought,\" Gupta said. In terms of what comes next, Gupta said this study will likely spark new questions about preventative measures, including masking and when Americans may need a booster shot. \"They're saying this is really, really contagious. So even if there's not a lot of viral transmission now, it's likely to increase, because of the contagiousness of this and also because we're going into cooler and dryer weather where we know virus tend to transmit more easily anyway,\" Gupta said. \"So, I think there's going to be some changes that come about here, with regard to those recommendations, both on boosters and masking, you know, throughout the country.\" On Tuesday, Walensky previewed these findings while unveiling guidance that people in areas with \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission should resume wearing masks indoors. Over 75% of the US population live in these areas. Here's a look at some of the key findings of the study:  Read more about the CDC study here. CNN's Michael Nedelman contributed reporting to this post.  Among millions of adolescents who have received the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, new data show that most of those who have reported side effects experienced non-serious conditions – and the heart condition myocarditis was listed among 4.3% of all reports.  Data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that among 8.9 million adolescents vaccinated between December and July, reports of adverse events were received for about 1 per 1,000 vaccines.  Overall, 8,383 or 90.7% of reports were for non-serious events and 9.3% were for serious events, including death. No reports of death were determined to be the result of myocarditis. Among the rare serious reports only, the most common were: chest pain at 56.4%; increased troponin, which can indicate a problem with the heart, at 41.7%; and myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, at 40.3%, according to the report. Some more background: Beginning in June, reported cases of myocarditis emerged among young people after receiving the vaccine, primarily among boys. Later that month, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning to the fact sheets for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccines. CDC researchers wrote in the new data that, as of July 16, the federal government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, received 9,246 reports among 12- to 17-year-olds after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, out of about 8.9 million adolescents vaccinated. The VAERS surveillance system relies on people to submit reports and might not be generalizable to the overall vaccinated population. Common conditions reported were dizziness, temporary loss of consciousness and headache. \"The findings summarized in this report are consistent with the safety data observed in preauthorization trials for Pfizer- BioNTech after vaccination among persons aged 12–25 years, with the exception of myocarditis, a serious adverse event detected in postauthorization safety monitoring,\" CDC researchers wrote in the report. \"Local and systemic reactions after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were commonly reported by adolescents aged 12–17 years to U.S. vaccine safety monitoring systems, especially after dose 2,\" the researchers wrote. \"A small proportion of these reactions are consistent with myocarditis.\"  ##Vaccines## A new study shows the Delta coronavirus variant produced similar amounts of virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they get infected – illustrating a key motivation behind the federal guidance that now recommends most fully vaccinated Americans wear masks indoors. Experts say that vaccination makes it less likely that you'll catch Covid-19 in the first place – but for those who do, this data suggests they could have a similar tendency to spread it as unvaccinated people. \"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,\" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement Friday. The study, published by CDC Friday, describes 469 Massachusetts residents who were infected in a July outbreak in Barnstable County, which includes the summer vacation destination Provincetown. No deaths were reported among them.  About 74% — or 346 cases — had been fully vaccinated. Of those cases, 79% reported symptoms. Genetically sequenced cases revealed the Delta variant as the main culprit. The researchers found evidence that viral loads were similar among 127 fully vaccinated people and 84 others who were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. Viral load is a proxy for how likely someone might be to transmit the virus to others. The finding that the Delta variant resulted in similar viral loads \"was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said Friday. On Tuesday, Walensky previewed these findings while unveiling guidance that people in areas with \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission should resume wearing masks indoors. More than 75% of the US population live in these areas. Although these findings motivated CDC to update its guidance, the study notes that Barnstable County was not one of those areas until the outbreak. Between July 3 and 17, daily new cases rose from a 14-day average of 0 to 177 cases per 100,000 residents. The study suggests that \"even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status.\" CNN previously reported on the outbreak connected to Provincetown. In total, at least 882 cases have been linked to the cluster so far – about 60% of whom were Massachusetts residents, according to local officials. A source familiar with the CDC's decision to update its recommendations previously told CNN that, in addition to the viral load findings, the overall prevalence of Delta and lower-than-hoped vaccine uptake played key roles in the latest iteration of the guidance. ##Masks## The Delta coronavirus variant surging across the United States appears to cause more severe illness and spread as easily as chickenpox, according to an internal document from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The document — a slide presentation — outlines unpublished data that shows fully vaccinated people might spread the Delta variant at the same rate as unvaccinated people. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky confirmed the authenticity of the document, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The CDC is scheduled to publish data today that will back Walensky's controversial decision to change guidance for fully vaccinated people.  The Delta variant's comparison to the chickenpox has prompted questions about how easily it can spread within a group of people.  Here's a look at how the Delta variant's spread compares to the early Covid-19 strain, according the CDC:  As the Delta variant continues to spread in the US, 49 states are seeing a surge in cases. Some experts say stricter vaccine mandates may be the best way to prevent a full downward spiral. Cases and hospitalizations are climbing across much of the US, although numbers are not anywhere near the peaks the country say in January. Deaths have also increased in parts of the country following steady declines. Here's a look at how Covid-19 data has progressed since the start of the pandemic in the US: Nationwide, there are about the same number of new Covid-19 cases reported each day as there were at this time last year, but they’re rising quickly right now instead of falling as they were last year, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. The United States recorded an average of about 67,000 new Covid-19 cases each day over the past week, compared to an average of more than 65,000 cases each day in the last week of July 2020. But at this time last year, cases were on the decline, dropping below 50,000 cases per day about halfway into August 2020. Most recently, average daily cases have been rising for more than three weeks straight.  While cases are trending up, average daily Covid-19 deaths in the US are a fraction of what they were a year ago. About 305 people died of Covid-19 each day over the most recent seven days, but more than 1,000 people were dying of Covid-19 each day at this time last year, according to JHU data.  You can track Covid-19 cases in the US here.  Owners and operators of all 41 Broadway theaters in New York City will require audience members and performers as well as staff to be vaccinated for all performances through the month of October, the Broadway League announced Friday. Masks will also be required for audiences inside theaters, except for when they are eating or drinking in designated locations, the release said.  Under the joint policy, guests will need to be fully vaccinated with an US Food and Drug Administration or World Health Organization authorized vaccine in order to attend and must show proof upon entry, the release stated. Exceptions, they said, are being made for children under the age of 12, as well as those with a medical condition or religious belief preventing vaccination.   ##Vaccines## ##Masks## A critical care physician in Louisiana has a stark warning for unvaccinated individuals: “You cannot avoid Delta. It is not possible. So you have a decision — and the decision is get vaccinated or not. And the results are telling us, if you're not vaccinated, you have a really poor outcome. If you look at our ICU patients this morning, 97% are unvaccinated and the average age is 48,” Dr. Christopher Thomas of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge told CNN’s Poppy Harlow.  He said the number of Covid-19 patients is affecting health care as a whole.  “We’re becoming victims of the unvaccinated at the current pace. We currently are overwhelming our bed capacity. We're creating burnout for our teams. And honestly, we're beginning to impact the rest of the health care of the community,” he said.  Thomas said his hospital currently has more than 50 patients in intensive care units, with 18 patients holding in its emergency department. There is also a shortage of nursing, he said.   “We're admitting one Covid patient alone per hour. So one per hour. That means that the other patients who need care are being impacted. We are looking over the cliff. I don't see an end in sight,” he said.  Watch:  An internal report presented to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates the Delta coronavirus variant is far more transmissible than older lineages, may cause more severe disease, and that when it causes breakthrough infections, may be as easily transmitted as when it infects unvaccinated people. What the document shows:  The slideshow dated Thursday and first obtained by The Washington Post, appears to provide some data backing CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky’s controversial decision on Tuesday to change the agency’s guidance on mask use.\nIt says the Delta variant is about as transmissible as chickenpox, with each infected person, on average, infecting eight or nine others. The original lineage was about as transmissible as the common cold, with each infected person passing the virus to about two other people on average. \nAnd if vaccinated people get infected anyway, they have as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people. But vaccinated people are safer, the document indicates. It says vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease or death 10-fold and reduce the risk of infection three-fold.\nThe CDC, the document advises, should “acknowledge the war has changed.” It recommends vaccine mandates and universal mask requirements. How the CDC reacted:  Walensky confirmed to CNN that the slideshow was presented to her at a noon briefing on Thursday. “I think people need to understand that we’re not crying wolf here. This is serious,” Walensky told CNN Thursday night. “It’s one of the most transmissible viruses we know about. Measles, chicken pox, this – they’re all up there,\" she said.  \nWalensky noted that the R0 for the Delta variant – a measure of its transmissibility – is estimated to be 5-9, meaning each infected person can be expected to infect 5-9 other people. “When you think about diseases that have an R0 of 8 or 9 – there aren’t that many.”\nAsked about the contents of the slide deck, Walensky said, “There weren’t any surprises. It was the synthesis of the data all in one place that was sobering.” What comes next:  The CDC is scheduled to publish additional data Friday that will back Walensky's controversial decision to change guidance for fully vaccinated people. She said Tuesday the CDC was recommending that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in places where transmission of the virus is sustained or high. CNN's Paul LeBlanc and Maggie Fox contributed reporting to this post.  The data behind an internal US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document that suggests fully vaccinated people might spread the Delta variant at the same rate as unvaccinated people is, according to the Washington Post, based on a Covid-19 cluster that emerged from July 4 weekend festivities in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Alex Morse, Provincetown’s town manager, told CNN's \"New Day\" that there are 112 active cases right now in the town, but the overall cluster number is more than 880 since July 1. Morse said 74% of the overall cases were among fully vaccinated individuals — but he credits vaccines with ultimately saving people’s lives.  “What's been interesting, and I think the silver lining here, is that the vaccine is clearly working. It is meant to prevent hospitalization and certainly prevent death. There hasn't been a single death related to the cluster here in Provincetown. There hasn't been a spike in hospitalizations,” Morse said.  According to the internal CDC, which was first reported by The Washington Post, the Delta variant is about as transmissible as chickenpox, with each infected person on average infecting eight or nine others.  Provincetown reinstated its indoor mask mandate after the cluster of Covid-19 cases emerged.  “The Delta variant is incredibly dangerous to unvaccinated individuals. And While we have a mask mandate in the short term, our longer term way out of this is really through vaccination,” Morse said.  Watch:  ##Vaccines## Vaccination alone won't stop the rise of new variants and in fact could push the evolution of strains that evade their protection, researchers warned Friday.  They said people need to wear masks and take other steps to prevent spread until almost everyone in a population has been vaccinated. Their findings, published in Nature Scientific Reports, support an unpopular decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advise even fully vaccinated people to start wearing masks again in areas of sustained or high transmission. \"When most people are vaccinated, the vaccine-resistant strain has an advantage over the original strain,\" Simon Rella of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, who worked on the study, told reporters. \"This means the vaccine resistant strain spreads through the population faster at a time when most people are vaccinated.\" But if so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions are maintained – such as mask use and social distancing – the virus is less likely to spread and change. \"There is a chance to remove the vaccine resistant mutations from the population,\" Rella said. The findings suggest that policymakers should resist the temptation to lift restrictions to celebrate or reward vaccination efforts. This is likely to be especially true with a more transmissible variant such as the Delta variant, said Fyodor Kondrashov, also of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. \"Generally, the more people are infected, the more the chances for vaccine resistance to emerge. So the more Delta is infectious, the more reason for concern,\" Kondrashov told reporters. \"By having a situation where you vaccinate everybody, a vaccine resistant mutant actually gains a selective advantage.\"  People should not complain, he said. \"The individual who already vaccinated and putting on a mask should not think this is pointless but should think that there is a vaccine resistant strain running around,\" he said. ##Vaccines## ##Masks## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it will release a study Friday that supports this week’s decision to change mask guidance. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday the agency was changing guidelines for fully vaccinated people because of new science. She said even fully vaccinated people should wear masks indoors in areas where transmission of the virus is substantial or high.  Walensky said new data indicated that people who get breakthrough infections involving the Delta variant of the virus can be as likely to infect someone else as unvaccinated people are. And she promised that data would be released soon.  ##Masks##","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200213175739-03-coronavirus-0213-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"How Europe's doors are slamming shut for Americans","date":"Sep 11, 2021","text":"It was too good to last.  While summer saw much of Europe open up to American visitors, offering them the chance to fulfill lockdown dreams of eating gelato in Italy or touring the art museums of Paris, the season's end has brought with it new restrictions, and the doors to the continent begin to close.  Earlier in September the European Union recommended that US visitors should be banned from nonessential travel to its member states due to rising Covid-19 cases in the States. The news has prompted various European countries to update travel restrictions for Americans, while some have prohibited entry to US travelers completely. Unsurprisingly, the changes have prompted widespread confusion, particularly for those planning to travel to Europe in the coming months. Here's a look at the tightened rules and what they mean for American travelers.   Can Americans still travel to Europe? Yes, they can. Only a small number of countries have so far restricted all nonessential arrivals from the United States. Since  the EU advice was issued, Bulgaria, Norway and Sweden are the only ones to restrict all access. However, while at least one destination -- Greece -- has ruled out imposing new curbs on travel in the near future, it's safe to say that Americans, particularly those who are unvaccinated, are likely to face more restrictions in the days and weeks to come.  What are the new EU rules? The European Union has dropped the United States from its safe list and advised its member states to reconsider allowing US travelers to enter without an essential reason.  Its advice is non-binding, however. There's no pressure for countries to adopt this measure and they're free to ignore it if they choose.  That means there's no blanket rule covering the continent. Instead each destination country is at liberty to adopt or ignore the advice according to their own preferences.  Given how valued US visitors are to Europe's tourism economies, it's likely that any decision to restrict their arrival will be taken with considerable reluctance. What do the EU rules mean for Americans traveling to Europe? A lot more red tape, uncertainty and research, that's for sure.  Ultimately it means that traveling to European countries is likely to become harder for Americans in the weeks ahead, although not necessarily impossible.  As the rules change, it's up to individual travelers to check their eligibility to travel. Although airlines may also do checks before departure, they won't need to in order to sell tickets. It's worth checking CNN Travel's Unlocking the World guides for up to date info where relevant or the US embassy in the country of destination. And then keep checking as the rules can change with just a couple of days' notice.  Some countries may keep their doors open, but tweak requirements such as pre-departure Covid tests, quarantine arrangements or proof of vaccination.  Which countries can Americans visit in Europe? Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain are currently all open to fully vaccinated Americans.  The restrictions in place vary from country to country. Many destinations require travelers to submit a negative Covid test on arrival, while some have both testing and quarantine measures in place for vaccinated visitors. France currently has no travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Americans, but a negative Covid test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival is required before they can enter Italy. A mandatory 10-day quarantine is set for fully vaccinated US travelers visiting the Netherlands, while those entering Germany must provide a negative Covid test result before being permitted to enter. Fully vaccinated Americans are allowed to visit the United Kingdom, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.  However different testing and/or quarantine measures have been implemented in each country. Is travel to Europe safe? No travel during the pandemic is entirely Covid-risk free, even for vaccinated travelers, and the best way to stay safe is to remain at home and minimize exposure to the virus.  That said, if safety protocols like mask wearing, social distancing and hand sanitizing are adhered to, there's no reason why travelers can't have a safe trip to Europe. Statistically, most western European countries have lower Covid rates than the United States. There are still Covid hotspots -- Montenegro recently experienced a major spike in cases -- so it's worth checking US Embassy travel advice at the destination. Again, it's a matter of research. Are more countries going to close their borders? It's not entirely clear. Since several European countries have introduced new restrictions for US travelers based on the EU's advice, it's possible that others will follow suit in the coming weeks. The restrictions have come about because of the spread of Covid's Delta variant in the United States, with cases reaching their highest numbers in many months throughout July and August. As numbers remain high in September, and colder months expected to fuel the disease's spread, more restrictions seem likely. What should I do if I've booked a trip to Europe? If you've booked travel to a country that remains open to Americans, you shouldn't encounter any problems provided you follow all of the recommended advice.  But if the rules have changed since you booked, many hotels and airlines recognize the problems with Covid and restrictions and may offer refunds if you've booked directly. It's worth asking.   As with all travel during the pandemic, there is however a risk that you may wind up out of pocket. Luis Araujo, President of the European Travel Commission, a nonprofit that promotes tourism in the continent, stresses that US travelers are still a huge priority for Europe despite the rule changes. \"American travelers are crucially important for Europe, and most European destinations are still open to US visitors and eager to welcome them back to our shores,\" Araujo tells CNN Travel in a statement. \"That said, we must accept that we are still living through the reality of this ongoing pandemic and will experience some setbacks on our way to recovery.  \"Travelers from the US still have to be conscious of health measures and respect rules at their destination.\" Should I book any future travel to Europe? As mentioned above, with any travel plans in the current pandemic, there are risks they may have to be changed or canceled. If you're looking for an escape entirely free of bureaucratic hassle, uncertainty and stress, then perhaps the answer is a straightforward no. But Araujo insists US citizens should \"continue planning their trips to Europe,\" while keeping \"an eye on all the latest travel rules and cancellation policies.\" He adds: \"Travelers are best advised to check the Reopen EU website and the websites of national tourism offices, which contain all information and safety requirements that are being regularly updated, including information on testing, passenger locator forms, as well as any other health measures in place. \"With current vaccination rates and safety protocols in place, safe international travel is absolutely possible, with this summer season proving that.\" Which European countries have banned unvaccinated US travelers? Denmark, Finland, France, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, and Spain have all banned nonessential unvaccinated US travelers. Meanwhile, all nonessential American travelers are prohibited from visiting Bulgaria, Norway and Sweden, regardless of their vaccination status. Which vaccinations are accepted in Europe? To be considered as a fully vaccinated visitor, travelers must have been administered with a complete dose of the vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) -- Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen -- two weeks before their trip. Can I travel to Europe with unvaccinated kids?  The new rules will not impact children who are too young to be vaccinated. Those under 12 can travel with vaccinated adults to European countries where US travelers are permitted to enter. But while under 12s are exempt from all restrictions in some countries, others require a negative Covid test.  Those aged between 12 and 18 are subject to the same rules and restrictions as adult travelers. Again, it's worth double-checking for each destination in case variations on these guidelines are introduced.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210211185716-dubrovnik-1-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"Bedlam on US airlines and more vaccine and mask mandates: What's new in Covid travel this week","date":"Aug 7, 2021","text":"There have been cancellations and chaos on US airlines, Canada and Japan have been cracking down on Covid rule-breakers, but the UK is opening up to more and more vaccinated visitors.  Here's what we learned in pandemic travel this week. 1. The US 'do not travel' list has got even bigger  US citizens have already been advised against travel to countries with more than 500 Covid cases per 100,000 residents in the past 28 days, which includes popular tourist spots such as the UK, Spain and Maldives.  Now the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given 16 new destinations its top risk designation of \"Level 4: Covid-19 Very High.\"  They are (deep breath): Andorra, Curaçao, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Iran, Ireland, Isle of Man, Kazakhstan, Lesotho, Libya, Malta, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Martin and the US Virgin Islands. That means US citizens should avoid travel to these places and, if they really must travel, they should be fully vaccinated. Check out the CDC's full recommendations list here.  2. The UK is opening up inbound and outbound travel  UK case numbers have fallen tremendously since England dropped nearly all Covid restrictions on July 19, but there were still close to 183,000 new cases in the past week.  However, the country has had a very successful vaccine rollout, with more than 58% of the population now fully vaccinated.  Wales is set to drop most restrictions on August 7 while Scotland will do the same on August 9. Northern Ireland -- across the Irish Sea -- has its own region-specific measures.  Fully jabbed travelers from the United States and EU are now allowed to travel into the UK quarantine-free -- although of course the CDC warns US citizens against doing just this.  In terms of outbound travel, the UK updated its \"green list\" on Thursday, adding Austria, Germany,  Latvia, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to the list for quarantine-free travel. You can read more about that here.  3. US airlines -- and their passengers and crew -- have had a rough week At the time of writing on Friday, Florida-based ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines had entered its fifth day of mass cancellations. It's been canceling hundreds of flights each day since Sunday, which the airline blames on weather challenges, system outages and staffing shortages. American Airlines was also in a cancellation frenzy.  Denver-based ultra-low-cost carrier Frontier had problems of a different kind.  A passenger on a weekend flight from Philadelphia to Miami was restrained by cabin crew after he allegedly sexually assaulted two staff members and was verbally and physically abusive. The airline was criticized for initially suspending the flight attendants, before later voicing support for the crew.  4. Israelis have been told not to hug Israel is facing a new wave of infections, with more than 21,000 new cases recorded in the past week. A government statement has told citizens to \"stop shaking hands, stop embracing and kissing and avoid any gathering in a closed space that is not necessary.\" Last month, Israel completely prohibited people from coming there from Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Cyprus, Georgia, Great Britain, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey and Uzbekistan unless they get special permission from Israeli authorities. 5. Canada fined two travelers nearly $20K over false Covid info Two travelers who arrived into Toronto from the United States in July were fined close to $20,000 each for noncompliance with entry requirements, according to the country's Public Health Agency. The visitors provided false information related to proof of vaccination and pre-departure tests and didn't comply with requirements related to on-arrival testing and staying at government-approved accommodation, the agency said.  From August 9, fully vaccinated Americans will be allowed into the country for nonessential travel -- but only if they comply with all government requirements.  6. Japan is naming and shaming rule-breakers The Japanese government is also getting tough on those who contravene the rules.  On Monday, Japan publicly named three Japanese nationals who broke quarantine rules after returning from overseas, reported Reuters.  Japan requires all travelers from overseas, including Japanese citizens, to self-quarantine for two weeks.  7. A Dallas firefighter 'faked Covid results then went to a resort' William Jordan Carter, a 38-year-old firefighter from Dallas, was charged with theft after allegedly taking paid leave for nearly a month while lying about testing positive for Covid-19. Bank records show Carter made several purchases during his time off, including nearly $1,400 at Kalahari Resort, a large indoor water park and resort in Round Rock, Texas.  8. A Carnival cruise ship reported Covid cases After a \"small number of positive cases\" of Covid-19 were detected aboard a Carnival Cruise Line ship, a new fleetwide mask policy requiring all guests to wear masks in some indoor areas was implemented on Wednesday night, the cruise line said -- two days ahead of schedule.  Carnival did not immediately say exactly how many positive cases had been detected aboard Carnival Vista, which departed out of Galveston, Texas. 9. More vaccine mandates have been introduced in the US and beyond  In the coming weeks, New York City will be rolling out a new policy requiring proof of vaccination to enter all restaurants, fitness centers and indoor entertainment venues.  \"If you're unvaccinated, unfortunately, you will not be able to participate in many things,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday.  Countries in Europe have introduced similar measures and incentives to try to get people vaccinated.  United Airlines is mandating Covid-19 vaccines for all employees, while Grant Shapps, the UK's transport minister,  said this week in an interview with the BBC that he thinks \"full vaccination is going to be a feature for evermore, and probably all countries will require full vaccination for you to enter.\" Finally, a White House official confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that the Biden Administration is developing a plan to mandate vaccinations for almost all foreign visitors to the US.  Officials are still in the early phases of developing the plan and an announcement is not imminent.","thumbnail-src":"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210805013515-william-jordan-carter-mugshot-story-body.jpg"}

{"web-scraper-start-url":"https://edition.cnn.com/search?q=Covid-19%20measures%20austria&size=30","title":"March 31 coronavirus news","date":"Mar 30, 2021","text":"Peru will enter a total lockdown starting Thursday through Easter Sunday to try curb the spread of the pandemic, the Peruvian government announced Wednesday. The total lockdown includes a 24-hour curfew, ban on the use of private vehicles, and only one person per household is allowed to leave home for essential shopping, according to a statement from the Peruvian Council of Ministers. Domestic flights and inter-city public transport will also stop, the statement read. The announcement comes as Peru is experiencing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases just days ahead of the first round of presidential elections, scheduled for April 11.  Peru has reported at least 1,533,121 Covid-19 cases and at least 51,635 Covid-related deaths, according to data collected by John Hopkins University. Massachusetts will be receiving more than 100,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine when nationwide shipments resume next week, Gov. Charlie Baker said Wednesday. “I can't tell you how important that is,” Baker said. “And as I’ve said before, thank God Pfizer and Moderna were there when they were there, but the difference between two doses and one dose is not just convenience, it’s also capacity.” “I think for many of us, this is a big sign, a big statement, and we have heard many times that it's coming, but it's coming. This is a big sign that things are actually starting to get here,” the governor added. Baker said it would be up to the state to absorb the growing federal supply and make sure doses get into people’s arms. ##Vaccines## Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday it had found a quality problem at a Baltimore plant helping manufacture its coronavirus vaccine under contract. The New York Times reported Wednesday that workers at Emergent, the Baltimore plant that has been making Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine, accidentally mixed up some of the ingredients, ruining as many as 15 million potential doses of vaccine and delaying US Food and Drug Administration authorization of the plant.  Johnson & Johnson said in a statement to CNN Wednesday that the quality control process at the plant identified “one batch” of drug substance that did not meet quality standards. The batch in question was a part of test run and quality check. The site is not yet authorized by the FDA to make the drug substance used in the vaccine. “This batch was never advanced to the filling and finishing stages of our manufacturing process,” the emailed statement from the company said. None of the lost doses impact the company's goal of delivering 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in March. For that, the company said Wednesday, it is on track. “This is an example of the rigorous quality control applied to each batch of drug substance. The issue was identified and addressed with Emergent and shared with the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA),” the statement said. “Quality and safety continue to be our top priority. Therefore, as we continue to work with FDA and Emergent toward the Emergency Use Authorization of the Emergent Bayview Facility, Johnson & Johnson is providing additional experts in manufacturing, technical operations and quality to be on-site at Emergent to supervise, direct and support all manufacturing of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine. In coordination with the US Department of Health & Human Services, these steps will enable us to safely deliver an additional 24 million single-shot vaccine doses through April,\" the statement added. The FDA told CNN it is “aware of the situation, but we are unable to comment further” and referred CNN back to Johnson & Johnson. The manufacturer, Emergent, also referred CNN back to Johnson & Johnson.   Last week: The Biden administration expressed some doubts the company could meet its self-imposed deadline, but by Friday, the administration seemed more confident that Johnson & Johnson would meet its goal, as White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients said, \"they appear on track to meet that goal with at least 11 million doses delivered next week.\" The FDA authorized Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in late February, but the company had struggled to ramp up production and failed to meet earlier production timelines that had been laid out in its contract with the federal government. The Biden administration has worked with all three authorized vaccine manufacturers to ramp up the supply of the Covid-19 vaccines. President Biden used the Defense Production Act to acquire new materials and equipment and brokered a rare partnership between Johnson & Johnson and pharmaceutical rival Merck & Co., to make more vaccines. That vaccine supply won't be available until later in the year. In February, Johnson & Johnson also said it had been working to expand its own manufacturing capacity and was expanding the number of third-party vaccine manufacturers with which it was working. ##Vaccines## The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant and negative impact on pregnant women and their infants, according to a global review of studies that examined the collateral impact of the pandemic on pregnancy outcomes. The study published Wednesday in the journal the Lancet, found that stillbirths and maternal deaths increased by nearly a third, according to pooled data from 40 studies that covered 17 countries.  The number of women who needed surgery for an ectopic pregnancy - when the fertilized egg grows outside a woman’s uterus that, left untreated, can cause life-threating bleeding - increased almost six-fold between January of 2020 and January 2021. The researchers from St. George’s University of London determined that many of these problems may stem from the lack of access women had to medical care during the pandemic. Hospitals were overburdened with Covid-19 patients and some women may have been reluctant to go to the doctor, concerned about exposure to Covid-19.  The number of women who reported symptoms of depression also increased, according to six of the 10 studies the researchers evaluated. Rates of maternal anxiety were also higher.  More context: Globally, the one rate that didn’t change much is the number of pre-term births. Pooled data from higher-income countries, though, showed a 10% reduction in preterm births. It’s unclear why. The rate stayed the same in low- and middle-income countries. “It is clear from our study and others that the disruption caused by the pandemic has led to the avoidable deaths of both mothers and babies, especially in low- and middle-income countries,” said lead author Dr. Asma Khalil, a professor of obstetrics at St. George’s University of London. “We urge policymakers and health care leaders to prioritize safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to the pandemic and aftermath, to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide.” Dr. Denise Jamieson called the results of this study “concerning.” Jamieson did not work on the study but is the James Robert McCord Chair in Gynecology and Obstetrics at Emory University and a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Covid OB Expert Work Group. “Overall, this provides compelling evidence that the effects of the pandemic go well beyond the effects of Covid infection,” Jamieson said. “It shows that there are far-reaching adverse effects on maternal and infant health that may last long beyond the pandemic.” Jamieson said scientists saw a similar pattern of problems in countries that were impacted by the Ebola epidemic that started in 2013.  “This is a pattern we’ve seen before,” Jamieson said. “When you have an infectious disease that consumes a lot of healthcare resources and affects large segments of the population, maternal and infant health suffer.” The Italian government has made the coronavirus vaccine mandatory for all health care and pharmacy workers, according to a new decree passed on Wednesday.  In a statement, the government said the measure was introduced to protect medical staff, patients and vulnerable people who are at a risk of infection. Health Minister Roberto Speranza said there was “great satisfaction” on the decree’s passing, adding that winning the “health battle is a prerequisite for a real restart of the country.”  Health care workers who refuse the vaccine will be reassigned where possible to not be in contact with patients. However, sanctions can include not being paid, according to Labour Minister Andrea Orlando who provided details at the end of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday night. The decree also protects those who administer the vaccine by excluding them of criminal liability as long as the inoculation has been carried out in accordance with instructions set by the health ministry.  The Italian government has also extended coronavirus restrictions until the end of April. The only exception will be for students up to 14 years old who will have to return to school even if they are in a “red zone,” the strictest three-tier system Italy has adopted to curb the spread of the virus. According to the latest data from the Italian health ministry there has been an increase of at least 23,904 coronavirus cases on Wednesday and at least 467 deaths over a 24-hour period.  This brings the total number of cases to at least 3,584,899 since the start of the pandemic.  ##Vaccines## ##Hotspots## Mounting evidence suggests the more contagious coronavirus variant first identified in the UK, which experts believe is partly driving an uptick of cases in places like Michigan, may already be dominant across the US. “I think we are there,” said William Lee, vice president of science at Helix, a company whose tests have identified a large share of variant cases across the country. “But at the end of the day, it's hard to say for sure,” given gaps and delays in the data. Lee is one of the authors of a study published Tuesday in the journal Cell estimating that the variant, known as B.1.1.7, would cause the majority of Covid-19 cases in the US by March 19.  According to that study, B.1.1.7 cases are expected to double every week and a half as a percentage of the country’s total coronavirus cases. The study also concluded the variant was introduced several different times to the US, as early as late November. The study’s conclusions were based on testing data through February. Lee said that there’s strong evidence the variant is already responsible for a majority of cases in states like Florida, Michigan and Georgia — with a number of others close on their heels, like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Texas and Southern California. However, Helix’s data does not include robust samples from a number of other states, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions. While officials with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention won’t yet say whether the variant is dominant, its scientists previously predicted this would be the case by now.  In January, a CDC study predicted that the variant would exhibit “rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March.” At the time, the variant was assumed to account for less than 0.5% of cases.  “B.1.1.7, we know from our most recent data, is about 26% of circulating virus right now,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a briefing Wednesday. This appears to be based on preliminary data of samples collected in the two weeks leading up to March 13, according to CDC’s website. “It is starting to become the predominant variant in many US regions,\" she added. A CDC spokesperson told CNN Wednesday that “national prevalence estimates are inherently delayed by a few weeks.” While the present-day picture of the variant is “unclear,” they said the agency expects to share its projections “in the near future,” based on mathematical modeling that’s currently underway. Nearly 12,000 cases of the variant have been identified in 49 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC, per the CDC. The agency said this does not represent the total number of such cases circulating in the US, but rather just those that have been found by analyzing positive samples. Florida and Michigan lead the country in these raw numbers.  ##Variants## ##Hotspots## Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced the state will be moving up opening Covid-19 vaccine eligibility to Kentuckians 16 and older from April 12 to April 5. Beshear said the state decided to move up its vaccination schedule because a number of other states are seeing increasing Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, and because Kentucky is seeing open vaccine appointments across the state that it wants to fill “So, starting on Monday, if you’re 16 and up, you qualify to get this vaccine, no other limitations out there. So, make sure you make your plan to get your shot of hope,” the governor said Wednesday. Beshear also announced that Kentucky’s Department of Corrections is now scheduled to receive extra Johnson & Johnson vaccines on either April 2 or April 5, which will cover all interested inmates as soon as next week. He noted that the Kentucky State Penitentiary and Western Kentucky Correctional Complex will hold off on vaccines for the moment, as they are currently recovering from an outbreak. ##Vaccines## Nursing homes have seen a 96% decline in new Covid-19 cases since vaccines started rolling out in late December, according to a new analysis from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL). By March 7, the country saw the lowest number of weekly cases and deaths since Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has been tracking them, according to the report published Tuesday. With 547 deaths the week of March 7, deaths were down 91% since December. Since December, nursing home cases have been declining at a much faster rate than community cases, the group’s analysis showed. “We are not out of the woods yet, but these numbers are incredibly encouraging and a major morale booster for frontline caregivers who have been working tirelessly for more than a year to protect our residents,” Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of AHCA/NCAL, said in a statement. “This trend shows that when long term care is prioritized, as with the national vaccine rollout, we can protect our vulnerable elderly population.” AHCA/NCAL represents more than 14,000 nursing homes and long-term care facilities around the country. The facilities provide care for about five million people a year.  The clinical trial for Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine designed to protect against the B.1.351 variant, first identified in South Africa, has begun, the US National Institutes of Health said Wednesday. First shots have been administered as part of Phase 1 of the trial that is taking place in the Atlanta, Cincinnati, Nashville, and Seattle areas.  The trial aims to enroll around 210 participants. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, current available vaccines should be “adequate” against the variant, but NIAID is continuing its work with Moderna on this trial “out of an abundance of caution.” The variant-specific vaccine is also an mRNA vaccine that targets spike proteins, like Moderna’s original vaccine, but the targeting takes into account the mutations that distinguish the B.1.351 variant.  The trial will be enrolling people who have already received Moderna’s initial vaccine as well as people who are so far unvaccinated. Participants will be split into eight different vaccine cohorts that will test different dosages and combinations. Some participants will receive only the variant-specific vaccine or the general vaccine, while some will be testing a combination regimen of the two.  ##Vaccines## ##Variants## Johnson & Johnson told CNN that it has met its goal to deliver 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to the US government by the end of March.  Last week, the Biden administration expressed some doubts the company could meet its self-imposed deadline, but by Friday, the administration seemed more confident that J&J would meet its goal, as White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients said, “they appear on track to meet that goal with at least 11 million doses delivered next week.” The US Food and Drug Administration authorized J&J’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in late February, but the company had struggled to ramp up production and failed to meet earlier production timelines that had been laid out in its contract with the federal government.  The Biden administration has worked with all three authorized vaccine manufacturers to ramp up the supply of the Covid-19 vaccines.  President Biden used the Defense Production Act to acquire new materials and equipment, and brokered a rare partnership between J&J and pharmaceutical rival Merck & Co., to make more vaccines. That vaccine supply won’t be available until later in the year.  In February, J&J also said it had been working to expand its own manufacturing capacity and was expanding the number of third-party vaccine manufacturers with which it was working. ##Vaccines## Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing (GRAM), the company that is doing some of the fill and finish work for the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine in the US, was given the certification it needs to provide commercial services to the European market, the company said Wednesday. The Grand Rapids, Michigan-based company was recently audited by the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate and was issued a European Union Good Manufacturing Practices certificate. That’s the last official piece of paper it needs to work in Europe.  However, J&J would not confirm if it will work with GRAM in Europe. J&J announced Monday that it will supply Europe with 200 million Covid-19 vaccines this year. Fill and finish are the last two steps in the manufacturing and packaging process for vaccines. The first J&J doses that went out immediately after the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine in February came from the GRAM plant.  Last year, the company expanded and added a new 60,000 square foot facility with new rapid vial filling equipment.  In August, GRAM signed a $160 million deal with the US Department of Defense and the US Department of Health and Human Services to expand the US capacity for manufacturing and the distribution of vaccines and therapeutics in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. GRAM got the emergency authorization to do the fill and finish work on the J&J Covid-19 vaccine in the US in February. GRAM said it will continue its expansion and open a new finishing center sometime later this spring.   ##Vaccines## The University of Pittsburgh is implementing a shelter-in-place for its main campus for 9:00 p.m. Wednesday, according to an official university email sent to students, faculty and staff. “This action is being taken to respond to a consistent increase in positive cases among students,” the email said. \"With the presence of the U.K. variant, B 1.1.7., on campus and in Allegheny County, the COVID-19 Medical Response Office (CMRO) is concerned that this trend will continue. Of significant concern is that the increase in positive cases since the end of last week is now among our residence hall students.” The news comes on the heels of a Tuesday report that there are confirmed positive Covid-19 cases in 13 of the university’s residence halls, along with 30 new positive cases between students and staff. A March 26 release confirmed 50 new cases the week before, 42 of which were detected in students. The shelter-in-place will remain effect “until the CMRO advises that it is safe to lift,” the memo said. Students are being advised to leave their rooms only to “attend classes, labs, or clinical in person; pick up food; exercise safely; work when necessary; and shop for essentials and medical needs,” and on-campus dining will be available to students through takeout options. ##Variants## An ensemble forecast published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects there will be 565,000 to 585,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by April 24. The agency's forecast has shown a general decline in projected deaths in the past weeks. The current forecast projects up to 566,617 deaths by April 10. That's about 7,000 fewer deaths than expected by that date, based on a projection from two and a half weeks ago. The lower estimate in the current forecast projects around 4,100 new deaths per week between now and April 24, while the upper limit of the forecast projects 9,900 new deaths per week over that time frame. The US has seen 6,960 new deaths in the last seven days.    More than 150 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US, according to data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC reported that at least 150,273,292 total doses have been administered, about 77% of the 195,581,725 doses delivered.  That's about 2.7 million more doses reported administered since yesterday, for a new record seven-day average of more than 2.8 million doses per day.  About one in six US residents – nearly 55 million people – are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and about 29% of the population – more than 97 million people – have received at least one dose, CDC data shows.  Note: Data published by the CDC may be delayed, and doses may not have been given on the day reported.  ##Vaccines## In a televised address to the nation, French President Emmanuel Macron said France risks \"losing control\" over the spread of Covid-19 without new national measures.  He said France would be extending the regional “reinforced slow-down” restrictions, already in place in 19 areas of the country, to all of France for four weeks. Under the “limited lockdown,” curfews will remain in place, domestic travel will be limited and people will be asked to work from home. The new lockdown measures will start on April 3 and last through May 2. “These rules will be extended to the entire metropolitan territory from this Saturday evening and for four weeks,” Macron said. “If we make this choice to extend them to the entire metropolitan territory, it is because no metropolitan area is now spared,” he added.  Macron said the new UK variant has created an “epidemic within an epidemic” and it is more contagious and deadly. Almost 44% of all Covid-19 patients in intensive care units are under the age of 65 he said. France has made the “right choices” so far but in the past few weeks the vaccine has “accelerated” and “things have changed.”  Starting Saturday all schools will be closed for three weeks. On April 26, kindergarten and primary schools can reopen. Middle schools and high schools can reopen on May 3, Macron said. “These last weeks we are facing a new situation. We have entered a race of speed,” the French president said as the number of patients in ICUs exceeded 5,000 on Tuesday – a first since April 2020. “We must therefore set ourselves a new framework for the coming months,” he added.  Macron said thanks to vaccinations, the country can see a way out of this crisis. \"A total of 250,000 professionals are now ready to contribute to this national effort to vaccinate 7 days a week,\" he added. ##Hotspots## ##Restrictions## Yemen has received its first shipment of Covid-19 vaccines via the international COVAX facility, the World Health Organization Yemen announced today.  It comes a week after the country's coronavirus committee urged the government to declare a public health state of emergency amid a rise in infections. The shipment included 360,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination, as well as 13,000 safety boxes and 1.3 million syringes.  It is the first shipment of an expected 1.9 million doses that Yemen is set to received through COVAX during 2021.  COVAX is an entity run by a coalition that includes the Vaccine Alliance known as Gavi and WHO. It is funded by donations from governments, multilateral institutions and foundations with a mission to buy coronavirus vaccines in bulk and send them to poorer nations that can't compete with wealthy countries in securing contracts with major drug companies. “The ministry of health will start targeting health workers and frontline health workers who are more exposed the virus of course,” United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund Representative Philippe Duamelle said. “Vaccines work, vaccines save lives, now let’s start getting people vaccinated”, he added. “This shipment represents an important step in the fight against COVID-19 in Yemen. It will help save lives, including of those at highest risk of serious disease, and will help protect the health system. These safe and effective vaccines will be a gamechanger, but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, physically distance and avoid crowds,” WHO representative Dr. Adham Ismail said Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) last week warned of a “dramatic influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients,” in Yemen, and urged for greater assistance from aid groups and donor countries. ##Vaccines## ##Hotspots## This morning, Pfizer/BioNTech announced today its Covid-19 vaccine showed 100% efficacy in youths ages 12 to 15. Shortly after, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona is “very confident” that children will be back in school for in-person learning in the fall. CNN's Ryan Young was in Atlanta as parents and students grapple with a return to school. Watch more: The European Union’s medicines regulator says there is “no scientific evidence” to support restricting AstraZeneca vaccine to certain age groups.  The European Medicine Agency’s (EMA) executive director Emer Cooke said in a virtual press conference that independent experts have looked at the cases, alongside scientists, to determine if there was any underlying risk factor that makes people more susceptible to blood disorders. They were not able to find any specific risk factors. This comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel limited AstraZeneca vaccine to people over 60 on Tuesday, following reports of a rare blood clot in the brains of 31 people since having a first dose.  “Two weeks ago on the 18th of March we gave an interim update of the assessment, and we concluded at the time that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalization and death outweigh the risks of side effects, and our position has not changed,” Cooke said. “[The] Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, a committee responsible for assessing the safety of medicines, continues to review all the data available and will aim to reach a scientific conclusion on the signal next week,\" she continued. Cooke added that the EMA continue to monitor all the scientific evidence available on effectiveness and safety of Covid-19 vaccines and will issue recommendations based on robust evidence.  When asked about Germany’s decision to restrict age limits, Cooke said they were asking their experts to evaluate if they can come to an age or gender based association, adding that Germany’s decision was a matter for the German government to take and not one for a regulator.   Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the World Health Organization's Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals reiterated the benefit-risk assessment for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine saying it still weighs very heavily in favor of its use. ##Vaccines##   The director of the US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, announced on Wednesday that the CDC is releasing new Covid-19 guidance for adult day service centers.  “These centers provide important social and health services to community-dwelling adults age 65 and older, as well as to adults any age living with disability,” Walensky said during a White House coronavirus press briefing.  “We know these populations are at high risk for severe Covid-19 disease and this guidance will help center administrators and staff protect themselves and adults receiving their services by promoting and engaging in preventative behaviors that reduce Covid-19 spread and help maintain healthy operations and environments in these facilities,\" she added. The guidance promotes a range of preventative behaviors and facility practices in adult day services settings, including guidelines on hygiene, building operations, shared spaces and transport.  Here's what the guidance said:  The CDC suggests limiting nonessential services and visitors, like volunteers and family members. \nIt encourages health screenings, signage encouraging the practice of preventative measures like wearing a mask and social distancing, modifying facilities’ layouts, and isolating staff and participants with symptoms or who may have had close contact with someone with Covid. \nIt also offers a protocol for isolating and transporting an individual with symptoms, as well as guidance on notifying health officials and close contact. \nA section in the guidelines related to centers’ activities suggests staggering activities and meals, as well as creating pods for center participants. \nAnother section related to food and dining suggests serving individually plated meals or grab and go meals instead of self-serve options. The White House's senior Covid-19 response adviser, Andy Slavitt, on Wednesday urged governors, mayors and local leaders to listen to President Biden and maintain or reinstate mask mandates to “save lives.”  “We need to keep case numbers down so we can save lives and give people the chance to get vaccinated in April, May and June so we can enter the summer on the strongest footing possible,” Slavitt said at a White House Covid-19 briefing.  “Now in the weeks ahead, that it will take to get everyone vaccinated for all of this effort, we need a simple thing of every governor, mayor and local leader, and that is to heed what the President is asking in return, simply to maintain or to reinstate mask mandates,\" he continued. “Together we can win this race and save lives,” Slavitt said.  On Monday, Biden called for mask mandates to be maintained or reinstated across the country in order to keep Covid-19 cases down. “Please. This is not politics,” the President said.   Biden’s comments came after Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a virtual White House briefing on Monday that she had a feeling of \"impending doom\" as Covid-19 were on the rise again.  “Right now, I'm scared,” Walensky said, sounding the alarm. Austria is likely to order one million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine ''as early as next week,'' the office of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.  \"We are in the final metres and a Sputnik order can probably be placed as early as next week,\" Kurz said in the statement, after he met with Russian Ambassador to Austria , Dmitrii Liubinski, in Vienna. Austria is hoping to make up for shortfalls in other vaccines ordered through the European Union, particularly from Astra-Zeneca. ''I am very happy about the binding delivery commitment. If we order Sputnik, we will still receive 300,000 doses in April; 500,000 doses in May; and 200,000 doses in early June. A very prompt delivery would therefore be possible here,'' Kurz said. But the two countries ''are still in the detailed coordination stage'' after weeks of discussions, he added. A data room has been set up and negotiations are ongoing between Austria's health ministry and the procurator-fiscal with the Russian side. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently reviewing an application for approval of Sputnik V in the EU.  Member states of the European Union have the authority to approve vaccines unilaterally, even if EMA has yet to authorize. ##Vaccines##   The White House on Wednesday announced the addition of three new federally-supported mass vaccination sites, which will be located in Tennessee, Wisconsin and Maryland, as part of the Biden administration’s ongoing efforts to address vaccine distribution inequity.  “The first is in Memphis, Tennessee, at the Pipkin Building at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium. The second is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Wisconsin Center. And the third is in Greenbelt, Maryland, at the Greenbelt metro station,” White House senior Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt said Wednesday.  Each site will be capable of administering 3,000 vaccine doses per day, and will open next week, per Slavitt.  There are now 30 total federally-supported mass vaccination centers, 25 of which are now fully operational, according to Slavitt. The White House announced new sites in Missouri and Indiana earlier this week, and previously-announced sites in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Virginia and Washington state are now fully operational.  ##Vaccines## On Wednesday, Iraq's Ministry of Health reported at least 6,664 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours. This is the highest number of coronavirus cases since the start of pandemic, The total number of Covid-19 cases in Iraq is now 850,924.  The ministry reported 37 new coronavirus related deaths, bringing the total number of recorded deaths in Iraq to 14,323 since the start of the pandemic.  There are currently 77,041 Covid-19 patients hospitalized across the county, among them 468 cases in intensive care units. ##Hotspots## Covid-19 was the third leading cause of death in the United States last year, after heart disease and cancer, according to provisional data released on Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC found the US death rate increased by 15.9% between 2019 and 2020.  Early data showed that the top 10 leading causes of death in 2020 were: Heart disease\nCancer\nCovid-19\nUnintentional injury\nStroke\nChronic lower respiratory disease\nAlzheimer's disease\nDiabetes\nInfluenza and pneumonia\nKidney disease Researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics analyzed death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System, taking a close look at deaths among US residents between January and December of 2020. \"COVID-19 was the third leading underlying cause of death in 2020, replacing suicide as one of the top 10 leading causes of death,\" the researchers wrote in the report. Suicide previously was the tenth leading cause of death but was bumped off the list for 2020 as deaths due to Covid-19 climbed.  The researchers report found that about 3.36 million deaths occurred last year. Covid-19 was reported as the underlying cause or a contributing cause of death for nearly 378,000 – or about 11.3% – of those deaths. The data showed that heart disease caused 690,882 deaths and cancer caused 598,932 deaths. The data also showed that, overall, death rates were highest among the Black and Native American or Alaska Native communities, adults aged 85 and older and men. The Covid-19 death rate specifically was highest among Hispanics, according to the CDC report. The data is provisional – and so numbers and death rates might change as additional information is received. Since investigating causes of death takes time, final data for a given year are typically published about 11 months after the end of the calendar year. In January, CDC statisticians shared with CNN that Covid-19 was likely the third leading cause of death in the United States for last year. Life expectancy in the United States also dropped a full year in the first half of 2020, according to a provisional report published by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics in February.  The report shows that US life expectancy fell to 77.8 years, back to what it was in 2006. You can read the full report here. Watch: Pfizer has met its commitment to have 120 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine released and ready for shipment to the US by the end of March, the company said on Wednesday. The company confirms it remains on track for its May and July goals as well. At the end of February, Pfizer’s Chief Business Officer John Young’s written testimony to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations said: \"We are on track to make 120 million doses available for shipment by the end of March and an additional 80 million doses by the end of May. And, we anticipate all 300 million contracted doses will be made available for shipment by the end of July, enabling the vaccination of up to 150 million Americans.\"  So far, Pfizer says it has shipped more than 100 million doses to the US.  As of Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed that more than 75 million doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US and more than 95 million doses have been delivered.  ##Vaccines## New York City has surpassed 4 million Covid-19 vaccination doses administered, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. That's more than the entire population of Los Angeles, he added. “Because we’re New Yorkers sometimes we hear big numbers and it kinda just goes right by us because we’re so used to doing everything big around here, think about that though, as many doses given as the total population of LA,” the mayor said. De Blasio said “everything’s clicking,” with more vaccination sites coming online constantly. However he cautioned that the city still needed vaccine supply to make it all work. ##Vaccines## The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued sweeping new recommendations to multiple government agencies Wednesday in a push for greater transparency and access to pandemic-related data. GAO calls on the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect specific data on vaccinations in nursing homes and make the data publicly available. The report also recommends HHS require nursing homes offer Covid vaccines to residents and staff and called for the agency to centralize its pandemic data on a single website.  CNN is reaching out to the department for comment.   “We want the government’s pandemic relief programs to be as effective and transparent as possible, and implementing our recommendations can greatly improve the federal response,” Gene L. Dodaro, Comptroller General of the United States and head of the GAO, said in a statement. “Our recommendations are focused on improving public health and economic recovery efforts and reducing fraud and overpayments.” The watchdog further recommends that HHS work to ensure “more complete” reporting of race and ethnicity information for Covid vaccine recipients, pointing to how HHS found that data collected from states on race and ethnicity were missing for nearly half of those who were vaccinated. “Without complete information on the race and ethnicity of persons who have received COVID-19 vaccines, HHS may have difficulty determining whether vaccines are distributed equitably to communities of color who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19,” the report warns. The new report also advises the Small Business Administration to address potential fraud risks in its programs. This comes after the Justice Department announced last week that federal investigators have identified more than half a billion dollars in fraud and charged 474 people with crimes related to theft of money from US Covid relief programs. Other recommendations include calling on the Department of Education to collect information on school districts’ finances related to their use of federal Covid-relief funds, as well as instructing the Agriculture Department to provide additional context for its data on federal nutrition assistance programs. Cuba’s health ministry reported 1,051 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, a record high number for the island nation.  The newly reported numbers bring the total number of coronavirus cases in Cuba to 74,212 since the pandemic began. The ministry also reported three Covid-19 deaths, bringing the total number of deaths to 421. In March, Cuba increased vaccinations with its homegrown vaccine candidates to try and bring transmission under control.  For much of 2020, Cuba was able to keep the spread of the pandemic under control but a bungled reopening to international travelers in December led to a surge in cases. ##Hotspots## The German city state of Hamburg has ordered further restrictions in an attempt to bring the coronavirus spread under control.  Hamburg Mayor Peter Tschentscher announced a curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. local time, starting Friday. Shops need to close by 9 p.m. local, he said. Schools will partly keep in-school education open. However, kindergartens will once again only be open for those with urgent social needs, for example parents who are key workers or those who have a home situation which requires children to be at kindergarten, as well as for single parents.   ##Hotspots## ##Restrictions## Delta Air Lines says it will offer for sale every seat on its flights starting May 1. The new announcement marks the end of pandemic-era social distancing precautions on board major US airlines. Delta was the last major carrier to cap capacity on its flights. In a statement, Delta says it feels empowered to officially end its policy because of more people getting vaccinated against coronavirus.  Delta CEO Ed Bastian said 65% of those who flew on the airline in 2019 anticipate having at least dose of the vaccine by May 1.   Other major US airlines that had blocked middle seats have already done away with the practice:  Southwest Airlines ended it last December, ahead of the winter holiday travel season. \nJetBlue Airways began expanding capacity last December and was fully selling its cabins by January. \nAmerican Airlines lifted capacity limits last summer, and United Airlines did not set capacity limits.  The announcement means the airline will let the policy expire on April 30 as scheduled. It had previously repeatedly extended the policy for months-long increments during the pandemic.  The benefit-risk assessment for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine still weighs very heavily in favor of its use, the head of the World Health Organization's Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, reiterated on Wednesday. Speaking during a news briefing on the biannual meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), Kate O’Brien said “it is a safe vaccine” when asked about Germany’s decision on who to administer the vaccine to. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country will only administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to people age 60 and above. The move followed reports of rare blood clots in the brains of 31 people following the first dose since the shots started being administered in the country.  “With the broad use of this, we anticipated that there might have been rare events that would be identified that may be associated with the vaccine,” she added. O’Brien said WHO supports decisions that any individual country may take, and that each country should \"chart a cours\" about how they will use the products available to them to fight Covid-19. “At this point, the major source of vaccine is the AstraZeneca vaccine. And what we're seeing from countries, remember there are over 190 countries or economies that are in the COVAX facility, is high demand for the AstraZeneca product and deploying that product,” she said. The chair of WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, Alejandro Cravioto, added the safety systems in place were working well.  “What we have asked every country is to have a system in place to be able to detect these problems, there should be a system in place to be able to follow up any of these adverse effects. And so the idea of bringing them up, publicly, is precisely so that everybody is aware that these are signals.”  ##Vaccines## Spain’s Health Minister Carolina Darias announced the country is seeing a slow increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, highlighting the presence of the UK variant in Spain’s regions.  “We are seeing an increasing trend in 12 regions while four report descending number of cases and three remain stable,” she said during a news conference in Valladolid where she was visiting the regional health department chief. “This context is concerning as we have seen the spread of the UK variant,” she said. “On national average we estimate the prevalence of this variant is from 60 to 70%, but in some regions it can reach above 80%”  But Darias did share some good news: The country is expecting arrival of more than one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine Thursday.  “We are at a crucial moment, we see a slow increase with an important prevalence of the British variant,” Darias added. ##Vaccines## ##Variants## Pfizer is planning to produce a new formulation of its Covid-19 vaccine that will no longer require a diluent in the second half of 2021, says Mike McDermott, Pfizer’s president of global supply. Currently, Pfizer’s vaccine comes in a concentrated formula that requires the addition of a saline diluent before it is administered. The new formulation would eliminate this step. “It's an improvement that we've made along the way that we think will help out for administration of the vaccine,” McDermott told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Pfizer will be required to submit an amendment of its current emergency use authorization to the US Food and Drug Administration before it is able to begin manufacturing this new formulation. ##Vaccines## Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on CNN’s New Day on Wednesday that one of the reasons for the high Covid-19 case numbers in the state is that Michigan has a high proportion of variants. Michigan has the second highest number of reported variants cases in the United States, with 1,237 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom and five cases of the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa. Whitmer told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota that the state is watching the trends closely and that there are a lot of factors behind the trends. \"Number one, we’ve got a high proportion of variants, and that means coronavirus spreads faster,\" Whitmer said. \"These are much more contagious and we’re seeing that whether it is at youth sports or it is the reengagement of some of our restaurants etc.\"  \"More activity means more spread,\" she said, saying that this was the reason Michigan, unlike some other states, had continued with measures such as mask mandates and capacity restriction on bars, restaurants and gyms. \"We haven’t abandoned our protocols, it’s just that we’ve got a higher proportion of variants,\" she said. \"And part of that is people getting tired, there’s fatigue, and there’s variants and there’s more travel and that’s some of what the story is here.\" ##Variants## Overall, at least 12,053 cases of coronavirus variants first spotted in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been reported in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Most of these cases, 11,569, are the more contagious variant known as B.1.1.7, which was originally detected in the UK. This variant has been found in 49 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC. In addition, there are 312 reported cases of a variant first identified in South Africa, called B.1.351, which has been detected in 30 states and Washington, DC, and then 172 reported cases of the P.1 variant first identified in Brazil have been discovered in 22 states. According to CDC data, three states — California, Florida and Michigan — have the highest total numbers of variant cases. Florida leads with 2,351 reported cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, 49 cases of P.1 and 15 cases of B.1.351.   Michigan has the second highest number of reported variants cases, with 1,237 cases of B.1.1.7 and five cases of B.1.351 and California has reported 822 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, 33 cases of P.1 and 10 cases of B.1.351. Note on the data: CDC says this does not represent the total number of such cases circulating in the US, but rather just those that have been found by analyzing positive samples. The agency cautions that its numbers may not immediately match those of state and local health departments. ##Variants## As coronavirus cases in more than 20 states in the US are rising, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Americans still need to be vigilant about the virus.  “We’re still at war with this virus,” Psaki told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota. “… People need to be vigilant now. We know people are frustrated. They're tired of sacrificing. We get that completely here. But we need to keep at it.” The administration’s focus is on getting vaccines out to states, she said.  Psaki said that states rolling back mask mandates and reopening fully are not abiding by public health guidelines.  “We're conveying that clearly to governors, but we're also conveying clearly that to businesses, to local leaders. Even in states where governors have rolled back these requirements … there are businesses, there are mayors, there are local leaders who are keeping them in place because they know it will save lives, that it will help return the communities to normal,” she said.  After Pfizer/BioNTech announced today its Covid-19 vaccine showed 100% efficacy in youths ages 12 to 15, Psaki said that Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona is “very confident” that children will be back in school for in-person learning in the fall. While the US Food and Drug Administration needs to do its own analysis of the data, Psaki said the news makes parents “feel even more confident about your kids potentially being back in the classroom soon.” Michigan leads the US with the highest number of Covid-19 cases per capita, and some experts say the rising case count in the state is a third surge. \"I think we are in the third surge in Michigan,\" Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN on Sunday, with cases increasing the most in people between the ages of 10 and 19. Khaldun attributed the rise in cases to a number of factors, including increased gatherings, reopenings and outbreaks in some prisons and schools. Outbreaks related to sports and student gatherings are a particular concern, with 315 outbreaks linked to student sports teams or recreational clubs in the first two months of 2021. Michigan is now testing more in schools and it will be mandatory for those playing sports. \"Anyone age 13 to 19 whose playing organized sports, they have to get tested at least weekly,\" Khaldun said. She added: \"If they have symptoms, they can't play at all.\" ##Hotspots## Russia has registered the world’s first animal vaccine against Covid-19, Russian state media TASS reported Wednesday quoting Konstantin Savenkov, the deputy head of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor). \"Carnivak-Cov, a sorbate inactivated vaccine against the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) for carnivorous animals, developed by Rosselkhoznadzor’s Federal Center for Animal Health, has been registered in Russia. So far, it is the world’s first and only product for preventing COVID-19 in animals,\" Konstantin Savenkov said. The vaccine will likely go into mass production as early as April, according to the TASS report. Clinical trials of Carnivak-Cov began last October, Savenkov said. The research involved dogs, cats, foxes, Arctic foxes, minks and other animals. \"The outcome of the research gives us grounds to conclude that the vaccine is safe and has strong immunogenic effect, because all vaccinated animals developed antibodies to novel coronavirus in 100%” Savenkov said, according to TASS. The report said that the effect of the vaccine “is estimated to last no less than six months,\" quoting Savenkov. \"According to Russian scientists, the use of the vaccine can prevent further mutations of the virus,\" the Russian official said, adding that multiple firms from Greece, Poland and Austria plan to buy the vaccine.  Savenkov added that companies from the United States, Canada and Singapore have also “demonstrated interest\".  In May last year, Denmark culled 17 million minks over concerns the animals were spreading a mutated form of coronavirus. ##Vaccines## Results from Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 clinical trial in 12 to 15 year olds mean that age group in the US could receive vaccines as soon as the fall, Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, told CNN.  The vaccine was 100% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, the companies said, and was well tolerated.  “I think it’s likely a green light to move forward, to move down in terms of vaccinating adolescents 12 to 15,” Hotez said. He added that \"by the fall I think there’s a good possibility we’ll be vaccinating teenagers, 12 and up.\" \"And for middle schools, junior high schools, high schools, it’s really good news in the United States for both teachers and staff. We’ll have teachers and staff vaccinated, we’ll have the students vaccinated in those middle schools and high schools.” Pfizer/BioNTech plan to submit the data to the US Food and Drug Administration as soon as possible for expanded emergency use authorization of the two-dose vaccine. The trial included 2,260 participants, and while Hotez said this was a relatively small study, he said he thought it was enough to move ahead with. Watch: ##Vaccines## French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to tighten coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday as case numbers and admissions to intensive care units soar across France, where the government has been resisting a third nationwide lockdown. Macron will address the nation at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) as he faces growing criticism over his approach to the current Covid-19 surge. His administration has favored regional restrictions over the strict national lockdowns imposed in other European nations, against the advice of France's scientific council. A nationwide 7 p.m. curfew is in place, while non-essential businesses are closed and movement restricted in 19 of the 96 departments on mainland France, but there are few other measures to slow the rapid pace of infection across the country. Macron, who is up for reelection next year, has justified the strategy by saying the country needed to consider the impacts on mental health and the economy in devising a balanced response to the third wave. But today, more than 28,000 people are being treated in hospital for Covid-19 in France, including 5,072 in intensive care units (ICU), according to French health ministry data. It's the first time since April last year that ICU patient numbers have surpassed 5,000.

The government statement said most of those who died were elderly or chronically ill. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told CNN the reason for the record number of deaths was the “British mutation” of the virus, referring to the B117 variant first identified in the UK. He said the variant was causing “relatively more hospitalizations and fatalities.” Hungary has the world’s second-highest coronavirus death rate per capita – 209 deaths per 100,000 people, according to data tracked by CNN. Among countries with significant population sizes, only the Czech Republic has a higher rate of coronavirus deaths. Hungary’s high death rate comes despite its not having a particularly high rate of coronavirus cases – its 6,609 cases per 100,000 people puts it in the middle third of European Union countries – and the second-highest vaccination rate in the EU, behind the small Mediterranean nation of Malta. Clinical trial results of Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine showed its efficacy is 100% and it is well tolerated in youths ages 12 to 15, the companies said Wednesday.  Pfizer/BioNTech plan to submit the data to the US Food and Drug Administration as soon as possible for expanded emergency use authorization of the two-dose vaccine.  In a Phase 3 trial of 2,260 participants ages 12 to 15 years in the US, the vaccine elicited strong antibody responses one month after the second dose, exceeding those demonstrated in people ages 16 to 25 in previous trials, Pfizer/BioNTech reported. The vaccine is currently authorized in the US for emergency use in people ages 16 and older.   Researchers observed 18 Covid-19 cases among the 1,129 participants who were given a placebo, and none among the 1,131 participants who were given the vaccine. The data has yet to be peer reviewed.  Pfizer/BioNTech added that the side effects observed in people ages 12 to 15 were similar to those seen in 16 to 25-year-olds. The participants will be monitored for protection and safety for two years after their second dose.   “We share the urgency to expand the authorization of our vaccine to use in younger populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.  \"We plan to submit these data to FDA as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.”   A separate Phase 1/2/3 study of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in children ages 6 months to 11 years launched last week, when the first participants ages 5 to 11 received a shot.  Pfizer/BioNTech plans to begin dosing 2 to 5-year-olds next week and work its way down to participants ages 6 months to 2 years. The company aims to enroll 4,644 children in the trial and expects results by the end of 2021.  Moderna is also testing its Covid-19 vaccine in adolescents and children, in two clinical trials of children ages 12 to 17 and those ages 6 months to 11 years.   Read more here:  ##Vaccines## China's foreign ministry on Wednesday said it was “immoral” and “unpopular” to politicize the issue of virus origin tracing after 14 countries, including the United States, raised concerns in a joint statement on the World Health Organization report released Tuesday, following its Wuhan investigation. “We have repeatedly emphasized that origin tracing is a scientific issue, and it should be carried out cooperatively by global scientists and cannot be politicized, which is also the consensus of most countries,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in a regular briefing Wednesday. Hua said the joint statement questioning the report is concrete evidence that countries like the US “disrespect science” and “engage in political manipulation.” “The politicization of origin tracing is extremely immoral and unpopular, which only hinders global cooperation and [the] global fight against the virus,” said Hua, adding the efforts run counter to the wills of the international community and will never succeed. Governments from countries including the United States, Australia and Canada, jointly expressed concerns about the WHO report released Tuesday on COVID-19 origin tracing in China and called for independent and fully transparent evaluations with access to all relevant data in the future. ##WHO Investigation## Chinese scientist and World Health Organization team leader Liang Wannian said Wednesday that WHO should do more Covid-19 studies that cover a wider range of regions and perspectives. “There is a consensus among scientists that the place where it was reported early is not necessarily the place where the virus first appeared,” Liang Wannian said at a news conference in Beijing Wednesday. \"Based on this, the perspective of tracing the origin of the virus must be broader.” This comes after the WHO report into the origins of the virus, compiled by a team of international experts and their Chinese counterparts, was finally released on Tuesday after several delays.  It provides a detailed examination of the data collected by Chinese scientists and authorities from the early days of the pandemic but offers little new insight or concrete findings on where and how the virus spread to humans. Following the release, the United States and 13 other governments, including the United Kingdom, Australia and South Korea, released a joint statement expressing concerns over the study's limited access to \"complete, original data and samples.\" ##WHO Investigation## Herd immunity to Covid-19 could come and go, scientists say. Or we might never reach it at all. Here are some of the obstacles to achieving and maintaining it.  Young People Very few people younger than 16 will get a Covid-19 vaccine soon. Dr. Anthony Fauci -- director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- has said younger Americans will likely have to wait until early 2022 for vaccines. And that's a major obstacle to  herd immunity. Young people may not get very sick from Covid-19 in high numbers, but they can still get infected and transmit the virus. Anti-vaxxers  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, 20% of people surveyed in the US said they definitely would not get vaccinated or would only get vaccinated if their job or school required it. If not enough people are willing to get vaccinated, herd immunity isn't achievable. And if that happens, the virus will have ample opportunity to spread. Variants  If the virus keeps spreading, replicating itself in new people, it has more opportunities to mutate. And if there are significant mutations, new and more dangerous variants could emerge. This could also mean that drug companies have to keep updating their vaccines to be effective against new variants, and it's not guaranteed that every vaccine will be successful against new variants. Immunity could wear off Dwindling immunity -- either from previous infection or from vaccination -- could be another reason the US could slip in and out of herd immunity. Scientists don't know yet how long immunity from vaccines might last. So people may need to get booster shots in the future, or annual shots that can work against new variants. That's how the yearly flu shot works. ##Vaccines## The UK is \"100% confident\" in the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine and the shot is \"safe,\" UK Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said Wednesday, after Germany  suspended its use in people under the age of 60. Germany announced Tuesday evening it would limit AstraZeneca shots to people over 60s following reports of “rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects” in 31 people following their first dose. People under 60 can voluntarily receive vaccine in consultation with doctors, considering individual risk. When asked if the UK government thinks it should look at the vaccine again, Jenrick said: \"No we don't.\" \"We're 100% confident in the efficacy of the vaccine, that's borne out by study after study by our own independent world class, regulators, and by recent research for example by Public Health England, that have shown that thousands of people's lives have been saved, since the start of this year alone, thanks to our vaccine programme,\" he told British broadcaster Sky News Wednesday. The minister added that \"people should continue to go forward, get the vaccine,\" adding that he certainly will, when his time comes. \"It is a safe vaccine and the UK vaccine rollout is saving people's lives, right across the country every day,\" he said. Read more here:  ##Vaccines## The United States and Germany are by far the biggest investors in coronavirus vaccine development, according to key research findings by the Centre for Global Health at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.  Research findings show that the two countries have provided a combined R&D investment of $3.7 billion in developing coronavirus vaccines -- the United States invested nearly $2.2 billion and Germany $1.5 billion. They are followed by a wide margin by the United Kingdom, which comes in at $500 million. ##Vaccines## It was supposed to offer insight into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. But since its release on Tuesday, the long-awaited World Health Organization investigation has drawn criticism from governments around the world over accusations it is incomplete and lacks transparency. In a joint statement, the United States and 13 other governments, including the United Kingdom, Australia and South Korea, expressed concerns over the study's limited access to \"complete, original data and samples.\" The European Union issued its own statement, expressing the same concerns in slightly softer language. The criticism follows an admission from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that investigators faced problems during their four-week mission to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected in December 2019. In a news briefing Tuesday, Tedros appeared to contradict the study's central findings by suggesting the theory that the virus escaped from a Wuhan laboratory should be followed up -- even though the report noted such a possibility was \"extremely unlikely\" and did not recommend further research on the hypothesis. Read the full story: ##WHO Investigation## A city in southwestern China near the country's border with Myanmar is going into lockdown after nine Covid-19 cases were reported Tuesday. Six of the nine cases found in Ruili city were symptomatic and three were asymptomatic, according to a statement from provincial health officials. Four of them are Burmese nationals.  Authorities said they will crack down on illegal border crossings from neighboring Myanmar, where the ruling military junta overthrew the country's democratically elected leaders last month, in order to prevent the virus from spreading further within China.  Ruili officials stopped all inbound and outbound travel at 10 p.m. Tuesday and began a citywide Covid-19 testing campaign at 8 a.m. Wednesday, according to a statement from the information department of Yunnan province. Chinese officials blamed smugglers from Myanmar for a previous surge of Covid-19 cases in Ruili in September. ##Hotspots## India recorded 354 Covid-19 related fatalities on Wednesday, the highest death toll reported in a single day since December 17, as officials warned the country must be on guard against surging cases. V K Paul, a health official of a government-led think tank, said the situation appeared to be going from \"bad to worse.\"  \"Clearly we have to be very, very, vigilant,\" he said.  Between March 24 and March 29, India set consecutive new records for the number of Covid-19 cases identified in a day in 2021, according to a CNN tally of figures from the Indian Ministry of Health.  Nearly 80% of the new cases over the previous 24 hours were reported from the six states of Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, according to figures released by the ministry on Tuesday. India has distributed more than 63 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines since it began vaccinating priority groups on January 16. Starting Thursday, anyone older than 45 can get vaccinated.  India has recorded more than 12.1 million cases of coronavirus and at least 162,468 people have died, according to the Ministry of Health. ##Hotspots## President Joe Biden believes Americans \"deserve better information\" about the origin of Covid-19 and further steps from the global community, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday after the release of a World Health Organization report that said the pandemic is very likely to have started with transmission from one animal to another, and then to humans. \"I think he believes the American people, the global community, the medical experts, the doctors -- all of the people who have been working to save lives, the families who have lost loved ones -- all deserve greater transparency,\" Psaki told reporters at a White House briefing. She spoke shortly after the US and 12 other countries released a joint statement raising questions about the WHO report and calling for independent and fully transparent evaluations, and the European Union called for better access for researchers and further investigation. Authorities in 219 countries and territories have reported more than 128 million Covid-19 cases and 2.8 million deaths since China reported its first cases to WHO in December 2019. More than 30 million Americans have fallen ill and more than 550,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. \"They deserve better information,\" Psaki said of Americans. \"They deserve steps that are taken by the global community to provide that.\" She went on to criticize China for its lack of transparency and called on Beijing to provide data and answers to the global community.

This coincided with a sharp decline in consumer demand for many products, pushing economies around the world into a deep recession.Global demand for goods has quickly bounced back, driven by the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, high levels of government support, and changing spending habits.As Christmas holiday is coming and willingness of people to spend in developed countries grows, demand continues to boost. But on the supply side, problems are also climbing for reasons that go beyond the pandemic.The COVID-19 continues to reduce the capacity of factories in Asia, making shipping and logistics more costly. Extreme weather events due to the global warming are also causing more disruption.While the power shortages in China have hit production adversely, the lack of truck drivers in the UK hinders distribution. In countries such as the US and Germany, there is concern about the port congestion.Shipping container shortage, the scarcity of critical raw materials such as rubber, timber, steel and semiconductors, and the lack of basic workforce, including truck drivers, which have worsened during the pandemic period, are among causes for supply chain disruption.The incompatibility of measures to curb the coronavirus by countries around the world also complicates the case as related restrictions are loosened more in the US, while strict measures still continue in Asia.This situation makes it difficult to take transport workers to the ports and centers where they are needed in the global labor market.Supply bottlenecks are already implying impediment in economic recovery in some countries, with experts warning that supply chain woes \"will get worse before they get better\".Problems in the supply chain are expected to limit production globally until next year.\n- Global supply chain under pressureIn its latest report, Moody's stated that ongoing supply chain disruptions are challenging the resurgence of global trade. While global trade is expected to grow by 9-11% in 2021, Moody's said that supply chain bottlenecks will limit the recovery.The increase in the freight prices of goods shipped from China to the US and Europe besides the lack of logistics personnel in those countries make it difficult for the goods to reach their final destinations, raising the cost and causing them to sit on the market shelves at higher prices.Data from the UN Trade and Development Agency (UNCTAD) showed that shipping from China to South America earlier this year cost five times more than last year.Freight prices on the routes between China and North America increased more than twice as well.As reported by the US media, there are nearly 500 large container ships waiting to dock outside the ports in Asia, Europe, and North America.Backlogs exacerbated by labor shortages and supply chain disruptions can take months to get through, leaving store shelves empty and consumers facing higher prices as they prepare for New Year's shopping, according to experts.Problems in the supply chain are slowing down economic activity in China, the US, and Europe.The Chinese economy, which grew 18.3% in the first quarter and 7.9% in the second quarter, lost its growth momentum and expanded 4.9% in the third quarter of this year.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global economic growth projection to 5.9% for 2021 and kept its forecast for 2022 stable at 4.9%, reflecting pandemic-induced longer-than-expected supply shortages and worsening pandemic dynamics.German think tank The Kiel Institute for the World Economy pointed out that global industrial output climbed above pre-crisis levels in early 2021 but has stagnated since then.The European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde also warned that the globalized nature of the eurozone economy is highly vulnerable to systemic shocks from supply chain disruptions, highlighting that bottlenecks hit the eurozone more than any other economy.Supply chain bottlenecks bring along inflationary concerns in the US and Europe.Rising inflation rates push central banks to cut their pandemic-period incentive policies, which affects global economic growth negatively.Problems in the supply chain had a hold on some companies' sales and profits in the third quarter. The downward revision in the sales expectations of publicly traded companies also put their shares under more pressure.Companies complain about rising material prices, extended delivery times due to delays in the supply chain and, in some cases, order cancellations.As the world economy moves into the final phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies and consumers feel the global supply chain is under pressure.The deepening energy crisis, especially in Europe, is causing serious damage and some surprising volatility in everything from transporting goods by train to growing vegetables in greenhouses.Governments are trying to combat the higher gas and electricity prices that have plagued energy retailers and important sources of carbon dioxide. Energy shortages hit Europe as well as China and India, causing power cuts.Experts point out that there is a history of worsening problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.The global economic growth through giving priority to cheap goods production instead of supply chain flexibility and the creation of a single country-dependent supply chain may be the main problems, analysts argue.Experts say that these problems will not be solved easily and that extending the working hours of employees in the logistics sector is a small step that targets only a part of the supply chain.\n*Writing by Tuba Sahin in Ankara\n                            \n                                \n                                    Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Zoran Zaev announced his resignation at the headquarters of his Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) party in the capital Skopje.NATO is reluctant to establish a dialogue with Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Sunday at a press conference following the G20 summit in Rome.\"We have no information about what NATO is going to do. We rely on facts, and these facts suggest that NATO does not wish any interaction with us,” he said, when asked whether NATO had sent any signals to Russia on establishing dialogue.French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met Sunday to discuss the hot-button issue of fishing rights in the English Channel that has plagued the two countries over the past few weeks.The 30-minute meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome had the two leaders vowing that practical and operational measures will be taken as quickly as possible to avoid a rise in tensions and that they would bring forth a “de-escalation” in the situation, according to a statement by the Elysee Palace.The United Nations Climate Change Conference, also knowns as COP26, began in Glasgow, Scotland on Sunday with new pledges expected to be announced in the fight against climate change.\"We have no choice but to make COP26 a success.

The EU Commission has agreed to buy billions of doses from manufacturers for member states – approximately 2.4 billion doses from Pfizer-BioNTech, 460 million doses from Moderna, 300 million doses from AstraZeneca, and 400 million doses from Johnson & Johnson.Initial procurement hiccups have been overcome and, currently, there is no supply problem in the EU. Vaccinations across the bloc gained momentum in spring and peaked by the start of the summer tourism season, with the EU Commission announcing in July that it had hit its target of vaccinating 70% of adults in the region of some 450 million people.According to latest data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, 77.6% of adult EU citizens have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 70.8% have received two doses.Western Europe steams aheadThe vaccination rate is particularly high in western European countries, with the number of people having received one dose now over 90% in some states and nearing 90% for double-jabbed people. In Malta some 91.1% of the population is fully vaccinated, 89.8% in Ireland, and 87.4% in Denmark, which recently became the first EU state to lift all COVID-19 restrictions.Portugal has managed to fully vaccinate 86.5% of its population, Belgium 83.9%, Spain 80.8%, France 79.7%, the Netherlands 77.2%, Southern Cyprus 75.2%, Sweden 74.1%, Germany 73.4%, Italy 72.8%, and 72.4% in Luxembourg.In eastern Europe, however, most countries are still well below the 50% mark. Bulgaria has the lowest rate of 21.4%, followed by Romania with 32.6%, Latvia 47.3%, Croatia 48.4%, and Slovakia with 50.2%.Bulgaria battles vaccine skepticismBulgaria, a country of some 7 million people, has reported more than 473,000 coronavirus infections and over 19,660 fatalities to date.Currently, the country has about 2,000 new cases and around 150 deaths each day, making for a much higher mortality rate compared to many countries.Despite free vaccinations and the public having the option to choose from the four jabs approved by the EU, Bulgarians have displayed a worrying aversion to COVID-19 vaccines.Compounding the situation is the fact that a majority of people are against virus safety guidelines, refusing to wear masks or follow social distancing rules.According to the country’s Health Ministry, around 98% of people dying of COVID-19 were not vaccinated, while hospitals are stretched to their limits dealing with virus patients. The government enforced some measures last week to redress the situation, including limiting attendance for indoor cultural events, banning spectators from indoor sports events, an 11 p.m. closing time for restaurants, and temporarily shutting nightclubs, discos, casinos and other entertainment venues.Rural headache for RomaniaRomania, which has a population of some 20 million, has reported around 1.26 million coronavirus infections and more than 35,000 deaths to date.The daily average case count is approximately 2,000 and the number of deaths hovers around 40.A particular area of concern in Romania is the country’s rural areas, where the vaccination rate currently stands at an abysmally low 14%. The lax vaccination coverage has been attributed to a range of factors, including a general distrust of authorities and fears about the vaccines and their possible side effects.Doctors’ hesitance to back vaccinations at the start of the nationwide immunization drive is cited as another reason – more so as the rate of vaccination among healthcare workers also remains quite low.The lack of public support from the head and priests of the Romanian Orthodox Church has also been a contributor, as the clergy is believed to hold particular sway over the rural population.Despite Romania’s grave coronavirus situation, the government has not enforced any strict measures in the country, except for making masks mandatory in closed areas and on public transport. There have been numerous reports of safety rules being openly violated in the country. The latest example came at music festival last week where masks – which were mandatory – were found to be scarce as some 56,000 people attended the four-day event in the city of Cluj.\n                            \n                                \n                                    Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Ahead of winter, just as we expected, we are starting to see this impact,” Javid said.“Cases are rising, and they could go yet as high as 100,000 a day. We’re also seeing greater pressure on the NHS across the UK, approaching 1,000 hospitalizations per day,” he said.“This pandemic is not over,” Javid said.The UK currently has one of the highest levels of COVID-19 cases in the world.In a sign of how serious the situation in the UK has become, Morocco announced today it was banning all flights from the UK effective midnight Wednesday.The UK’s infection rate is 66 times that of Morocco over the past seven days.Morocco’s ban also applies to Germany and the Netherlands.The UK recorded on Wednesday case numbers close to 50,000 for the second time this week, with yesterday’s daily infection numbers being the highest since mid-July.Call for people to get booster jabsAll this has led to health officials in the country to call on the government to implement its Plan B, which includes face masks and working from home.Javid resisted these calls in his press briefing, however.Instead, he called on over-50s to get the booster vaccination shots, saying: “All of these precious moments we’ve been able to restore over the past few months, the loved ones we’ve been able to see and the collective experiences we’ve been able to share, they’ve been possible because of our vaccination program and because so many of you came forward when it was your time.“If we want to secure these freedoms for the long-term, the best thing that we can do is come forward once again when that moment comes.”He continued by outlining other ways the British public could help limit the rise in cases: “After the decisive steps we’ve taken this year, none of us want to go backwards now, so we must all play our part in this national mission and think about what we can do to make a difference.“Although vaccinations are our primary form of defense, there are many more things we can all do to contain the spread of this virus, like meeting outdoors where it’s possible, and if you can only meet indoors, letting in fresh air. Like wearing a face covering in crowded enclosed spaces, especially if you’re coming into contact with people you don’t normally meet. And like taking rapid tests as part of your weekly routine,” Javid said.The British health secretary also touched on the new Delta variant AY.4.2, which is thought to be slightly more transmissible.“That new variant is now spreading, and while there’s no reason to believe at this time that AY.4.2 poses a greater threat, the next variant or the one after that might do,” he said.Nevertheless, Javid said that the UK needed “to be ready for what’s around the corner,” adding that the UK Health Security Agency will continue to assess whether AY.4.2 is likely to become dominant across Britain.Antiviral drugsJavid also announced that the UK secured deals for two antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 this winter, pending regulatory approval.Britain will buy 730,000 courses of treatments by Pfizer and Merck, with the drugs called PF-07321332 and molnupiravir respectively.They will be given to patients before they get seriously ill, helping reduce the chances of their condition deteriorating to the point that they need to go to the hospital.Both drugs are yet to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.Javid said: “Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have been building an armory of life-saving measures to tackle the virus and protect the country – including our phenomenal vaccination programmed and therapeutics.“I am delighted to confirm we may soon have a new defense in our arsenal with two new antiviral drugs that we have secured. Our work is far from done though – and we’ll continue our tireless work to secure more innovative treatments so we can protect as many people as possible from the virus, its variants and future diseases.”British government data published on Wednesday showed that there were a further 49,139 cases recorded across the UK over the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to over 8.5 million. There were also a further 179 deaths, bringing the total to 139,031.Up to and including 19 October 2021, over 49.5 million first doses of vaccine have been administered, or 86.1% of the population aged 12 or over, and over 45.4 million second doses of vaccine, or 79%.\n                            \n                                \n                                    Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Sharing Pakistan’s perspective, Qureshi emphasized the importance of proceeding with a realistic approach in view of the changed reality in Afghanistan.He said the well-being of the Afghan people must remain the focus, as they had suffered enormously due to prolonged conflict and instability for more than 40 years.A shared approach, he underlined, would help Afghanistan on its path to peace and stability and would result in enhanced economic integration and realization of connectivity projects.​Qureshi called for the international community to give top priority to addressing the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and preventing an economic meltdown.  Iran warns against foreign interferenceIran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian reaffirmed Tehran’s commitment to help “fulfill the will of the Afghan people, to establish stability and peace in the country, and to form an inclusive government that reflects the ethnic and demographic composition of the country,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.The minister emphasized the need for consistent dialogue and urged the neighboring countries to help prevent foreign interference in Afghanistan, according to Khatibzadeh.The next meeting of foreign ministers of Afghanistan’s neighbors will be held in person in Tehran within a month or two if the COVID-19 situation allows it, Khatibzadeh added.  ‘US, allies should learn a lesson’The hasty pullout of the US and its allies from Afghanistan indicates that “power politics, military intervention and the so-called democratic transformation” they pursued have ended in failure, the top Chinese diplomat said.The US and its allies should learn a lesson and assume their due responsibility as “initiators” of the problems, he maintained.“They have more of a duty to supply economic, livelihood and humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people than any other country,” Wang was quoted as saying by CGTN. Afghanistan faces grave challengesWang said Afghanistan still faces serious challenges, such as a humanitarian crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, adding that some international forces are likely to create “new problems for Kabul through political, economic and financial measures.” ​​​​​​​He said China will provide Afghanistan with food, winter supplies, vaccines and medicines.In his address at the Ministerial Coordination Session jointly hosted by the US and Germany on Wednesday, Pakistan’s top diplomat warned that Afghanistan was on the brink of a “humanitarian catastrophe.”“We have all seen the reports of famine, food shortages, and soaring inflation in Afghanistan,” Qureshi said. He said there was “some consolation that the sudden collapse of the former Afghan government has not caused the mass exodus of refugees from Afghanistan that we had feared.”“But we must be cautious that an economic meltdown does not instead trigger such a crisis. While Afghanistan’s immediate neighbors, especially Pakistan, would bear the immediate brunt of such a calamity, we would all feel its aftershocks eventually. Sustained economic support is essential to alleviate the sufferings of Afghan people,” he stressed.\n                            \n                                \n                                    Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.
